PHILIP PULLMAN



A KNOPF PAPEPERBACK
ALFRED A. KNOPF	*	NEW YORK




Into this wild abyss,

The womb of nature and perhaps her grave,

Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,

But all these in their pregnant causes mixed

Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,

Unless the almighty maker them ordain

His dark materials to create more worlds,

Into this wild abyss the wary fiend

Stood on the brink of hell and looked a while,

Pondering his voyage...


-John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II







The Golden Compass forms the first part of a story in three volumes.",未知
"The first volume is set in a universe like ours, but different in many ways.",未知
The second volume is set partly in the universe we know.,未知
The third volume will move between the universes.,未知
"PART   ONE

OXFORD

THE DECANTER OF TOKAY




Lyra and her daemon moved through the darkening hall, taking care to keep to one side, out of sight of the kitchen.",未知
"The three great tables that ran the length of the hall were laid already, the silver and the glass catching what little light there was, and the long benches were pulled out ready for the guests.",未知
Portraits of former Masters hung high up in the gloom along the walls.,未知
"Lyra reached the dais and looked back at the open kitchen door, and, seeing no one, stepped up beside the high table.",未知
"The places here were laid with gold, not silver, and the fourteen seats were not oak benches but mahogany chairs with velvet cushions.",未知
Lyra stopped beside the Master's chair and flicked the biggest glass gently with a fingernail.,未知
The sound rang clearly through the hall.,未知
"""You're not taking this seriously,"" whispered her daemon.",未知
"""Behave yourself.""",未知
"Her daemon's name was Pantalaimon, and he was currently in the form of a moth, a dark brown one so as not to show up in the darkness of the hall.",未知
"""They're making too much noise to hear from the kitchen,"" Lyra whispered back.",未知
"""And the Steward doesn't come in till the first bell.",未知
"Stop fussing.""",未知
"But she put her palm over the ringing crystal anyway, and Pantalaimon fluttered ahead and through the slightly open door of the Retiring Room at the other end of the dais.",未知
After a moment he appeared again.,未知
"""There's no one there,"" he whispered.",未知
"""But we must be quick.""",未知
"Crouching behind the high table, Lyra darted along and through the door into the Retiring Room, where she stood up and looked around.",未知
"The only light in here came from the fireplace, where a bright blaze of logs settled slightly as she looked, sending a fountain of sparks up into the chimney.",未知
"She had lived most of her life in the College, but had never seen the Retiring Room before: only Scholars and their guests were allowed in here, and never females.",未知
Even the maidservants didn't clean in here.,未知
That was the Butler's job alone.,未知
Pantalaimon settled on her shoulder.,未知
"""Happy now?",未知
"Can we go?""",未知
he whispered.,未知
"""Don't be silly!",未知
"I want to look around!""",未知
"It was a large room, with an oval table of polished rosewood on which stood various decanters and glasses, and a silver smoking stand with a rack of pipes.",未知
On a sideboard nearby there was a little chafing dish and a basket of poppy heads.,未知
"""They do themselves well, don't they, Pan?""",未知
she said under her breath.,未知
She sat in one of the green leather armchairs.,未知
"It was so deep she found herself nearly lying down, but she sat up again and tucked her legs under her to look at the portraits on the walls.",未知
"More old Scholars, probably; robed, bearded, and gloomy, they stared out of their frames in solemn disapproval.",未知
"""What d'you think they talk about?""",未知
"Lyra said, or began to say, because before she'd finished the question she heard voices outside the door.",未知
"""Behind the chair-quick!""",未知
"whispered Pantalaimon, and in a flash Lyra was out of the armchair and crouching behind it.",未知
"It wasn't the best one for hiding behind: she'd chosen one in the very center of the room, and unless she kept very quiet...",未知
"The door opened, and the light changed in the room; one of the incomers was carrying a lamp, which he put down on the sideboard.",未知
"Lyra could see his legs, in their dark green trousers and shiny black shoes.",未知
It was a servant.,未知
"Then a deep voice said, ""Has Lord Asriel arrived yet?""",未知
It was the Master.,未知
"As Lyra held her breath, she saw the servant's daemon (a dog, like all servants' daemons) trot in and sit quietly at his feet, and then the Master's feet became visible too, in the shabby black shoes he always wore.",未知
"""No, Master,"" said the Butler.",未知
"""No word from the aerodock, either.""",未知
"""I expect he'll be hungry when he arrives.",未知
"Show him straight into Hall, will you?""",未知
"""Very good, Master.""",未知
"""And you've decanted some of the special Tokay for him?""",未知
"""Yes, Master.",未知
"The 1898, as you ordered.",未知
"His Lordship is very partial to that, I remember.""",未知
"""Good.",未知
"Now leave me, please.""",未知
"""Do you need the lamp, Master?""",未知
"""Yes, leave that too.",未知
"Look in during dinner to trim it, will you?""",未知
"The Butler bowed slightly and turned to leave, his daemon trotting obediently after him.",未知
"From her not-much-of-a-hiding place Lyra watched as the Master went to a large oak wardrobe in the corner of the room, took his gown from a hanger, and pulled it laboriously on.",未知
"The Master had been a powerful man, but he was well over seventy now, and his movements were stiff and slow.",未知
"The Master's daemon had the form of a raven, and as soon as his robe was on, she jumped down from the wardrobe and settled in her accustomed place on his right shoulder.",未知
"Lyra could feel Pantalaimon bristling with anxiety, though he made no sound.",未知
"For herself, she was pleasantly excited.",未知
"The visitor mentioned by the Master, Lord Asriel, was her uncle, a man whom she admired and feared greatly.",未知
"He was said to be involved in high politics, in secret exploration, in distant warfare, and she never knew when he was going to appear.",未知
"He was fierce: if he caught her in here she'd be severely punished, but she could put up with that.",未知
"What she saw next, however, changed things completely.",未知
The Master took from his pocket a folded paper and laid it on the table beside the wine.,未知
"He took the stopper out of the mouth of a decanter containing a rich golden wine, unfolded the paper, and poured a thin stream of white powder into the decanter before crumpling the paper and throwing it into the fire.",未知
"Then he took a pencil from his pocket, stirred the wine until the powder had dissolved, and replaced the stopper.",未知
His daemon gave a soft brief squawk.,未知
"The Master replied in an undertone, and looked around with his hooded, clouded eyes before leaving through the door he'd come in by.",未知
"Lyra whispered, ""Did you see that, Pan?""",未知
"""Of course I did!",未知
"Now hurry out, before the Steward comes!""",未知
"But as he spoke, there came the sound of a bell ringing once from the far end of the hall.",未知
"""That's the Steward's bell!""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""I thought we had more time than that.""",未知
"Pantalaimon fluttered swiftly to the hall door, and swiftly back.",未知
"""The Steward's there already,"" he said.",未知
"""And you can't get out of the other door...""
The other door, the one the Master had entered and left by, opened onto the busy corridor between the library and the Scholars' common room.",未知
"At this time of day it was thronged with men pulling on their gowns for dinner, or hurrying to leave papers or briefcases in the common room before moving nto the hall.",未知
"Lyra had planned to leave the way she'd come, banking on another few minutes before the Steward's bell rang.",未知
"And if she hadn't seen the Master tipping that powder into the wine, she might have risked the Steward's anger, or hoped to avoid being noticed in the busy corridor.",未知
"But she was confused, and that made her hesitate.",未知
Then she heard heavy footsteps on the dais.,未知
The Steward was coming to make sure the Retiring Room was ready for the Scholars' poppy and wine after dinner.,未知
"Lyra darted to the oak wardrobe, opened it, and hid inside, pulling the door shut just as the Steward entered.",未知
"She had no fear for Pantalaimon: the room was somber colored, and he could always creep under a chair.",未知
"She heard the Steward's heavy wheezing, and through the crack where the door hadn't quite shut she saw him adjust the pipes in the rack by the smoking stand and cast a glance over the decanters and glasses.",未知
Then he smoothed the hair over his ears with both palms and said something to his daemon.,未知
"He was a servant, so she was a dog; but a superior servant, so a superior dog.",未知
"In fact, she had the form of a red setter.",未知
"The daemon seemed suspicious, and cast around as if she'd sensed an intruder, but didn't make for the wardrobe, to Lyra's intense relief.",未知
"Lyra was afraid of the Steward, who had twice beaten her.",未知
Lyra heard a tiny whisper; obviously Pantalaimon had squeezed in beside her.,未知
"""We're going to have to stay here now.",未知
"Why don't you listen to me?""",未知
She didn't reply until the Steward had left.,未知
"It was his job to supervise the waiting at the high table; she could hear the Scholars coming into the hall, the murmur of voices, the shuffle of feet.",主谓宾
"""It's a good thing I didn't,"" she whispered back.",未知
"""We wouldn't have seen the Master put poison in the wine otherwise.",未知
"Pan, that was the Tokay he asked the Butler about!",未知
"They're going to kill Lord Asriel!""",未知
"""You don't know it's poison.""",未知
"""Oh, of course it is.",未知
"Don't you remember, he made the Butler leave the room before he did it?",未知
"If it was innocent, it wouldn't have mattered the Butler seeing.",未知
And I know there's something going on-something political.,未知
The servants have been talking about it for days.,未知
"Pan, we could prevent a murder!""",未知
"""I've never heard such nonsense,"" he said shortly.",未知
"""How do you think you're going to keep still for four hours in this poky wardrobe?",未知
Let me go and look in the corridor.,未知
"I'll tell you when it's clear.""",未知
"He fluttered from her shoulder, and she saw his little shadow appear in the crack of light.",未知
"""It's no good, Pan, I'm staying,"" she said.",未知
"""There's another robe or something here.",未知
I'll put that on the floor and make myself comfortable.,未知
"I've just got to see what they do.""",未知
She had been crouching.,未知
"She carefully stood up, feeling around for the clothes hangers in order not to make a noise, and found that the wardrobe was bigger than she'd thought.",未知
"There were several academic robes and hoods, some with fur around them, most faced with silk.",there be句型
"""I wonder if these are all the Master's?""",未知
she whispered.,未知
"""When he gets honorary degrees from other places, perhaps they give him fancy robes and he keeps them here for dressing-up....Pan, do you really think it's not poison in that wine?""",未知
"""No,"" he said.",未知
"""I think it is, like you do.",未知
And I think it's none of our business.,未知
And I think it would be the silliest thing you've ever done in a lifetime of silly things to interfere.,未知
"It's nothing to do with us.""",未知
"""Don't be stupid,"" Lyra said.",未知
"""I can't sit in here and watch them give him poison!""",未知
"""Come somewhere else, then.""",未知
"""You're a coward, Pan.""",未知
"""Certainly I am.",未知
May I ask what you intend to do?,未知
Are you going to leap out and snatch the glass from his trembling fingers?,一般疑问句
"What did you have in mind?""",未知
"""I didn't have anything in mind, and well you know it,"" she snapped quietly.",未知
"""But now I've seen what the Master did, I haven't got any choice.",未知
"You're supposed to know about conscience, aren't you?",未知
"How can I just go and sit in the library or somewhere and twiddle my thumbs, knowing what's going to happen?",特殊疑问句
"I don't intend to do that, I promise you.""",未知
"""This is what you wanted all the time,"" he said after a moment.",未知
"""You wanted to hide in here and watch.",未知
"Why didn't I realize that before?""",未知
"""All right, I do,"" she said.",未知
"""Everyone knows they get up to something secret.",未知
They have a ritual or something.,未知
"And I just wanted to know what it was.""",未知
"""It's none of your business!",未知
If they want to enjoy their little secrets you should just feel superior and let them get on with it.,未知
"Hiding and spying is for silly children.""",未知
"""Exactly what I knew you'd say.",未知
"Now stop nagging.""",未知
"The two of them sat in silence for a while, Lyra uncomfortable on the hard floor of the wardrobe and Pantalaimon self-righteously twitching his temporary antennae on one of the robes.",未知
"Lyra felt a mixture of thoughts contending in her head, and she would have liked nothing better than to share them with her daemon, but she was proud too.",未知
Perhaps she should try to clear them up without his help.,未知
"Her main thought was anxiety, and it wasn't for herself.",未知
She'd been in trouble often enough to be used to it.,未知
"This time she was anxious about Lord Asriel, and about what this all meant.",未知
"It wasn't often that he visited the college, and the fact that this was a time of high political tension meant that he hadn't come simply to eat and drink and smoke with a few old friends.",未知
"She knew that both Lord Asriel and the Master were members of the Cabinet Council, the Prime Minister's special advisory body, so it might have been something to do with that; but meetings of the Cabinet Council were held in the palace, not in the Retiring Room of Jordan College.",未知
Then there was the rumor that had been keeping the College servants whispering for days.,未知
"It was said that the Tartars had invaded Muscovy, and were surging north to St. Petersburg, from where they would be able to dominate the Baltic Sea and eventually overcome the entire west of Europe.",未知
"And Lord Asriel had been in the far North: when she'd seen him last, he was preparing an expedition to Lapland...
""Pan,"" she whispered.",未知
"""Yes?""",未知
"""Do you think there'll be a war?""",未知
"""Not yet.",未知
"Lord Asriel wouldn't be dining here if it was going to break out in the next week or so.""",未知
"""That's what I thought.",未知
"But later?""",未知
"""Shh!",未知
"Someone's coming.""",未知
She sat up and put her eye to the crack of the door.,未知
"It was the Butler, coming to trim the lamp as the Master had ordered him to.",未知
"The common room and the library were lit by anbar-ic power, but the Scholars preferred the older, softer naphtha lamps in the Retiring Room.",未知
They wouldn't change that in the Master's lifetime.,未知
"The Butler trimmed the wick, and put another log on the fire as well, and then listened carefully at the hall door before helping himself to a handful of leaf from the smoking stand.",未知
"He had hardly replaced the lid when the handle of the other door turned, making him jump nervously.",未知
Lyra tried not to laugh.,未知
The Butler hastily stuffed the leaf into his pocket and turned to face the incomer.,未知
"""Lord Asriel!""",未知
"he said, and a shiver of cold surprise ran down Lyra's back.",未知
"She couldn't see him from where she was, and she tried to smother the urge to move and look.",未知
"""Good evening, Wren,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
Lyra always heard that harsh voice with a mixture of pleasure and apprehension.,未知
"""I arrived too late to dine.",未知
"I'll wait in here.""",未知
The Butler looked uncomfortable.,未知
"Guests entered the Retiring Room at the Master's invitation only, and Lord Asriel knew that; but the Butler also saw Lord Asriel looking pointedly at the bulge in his pocket, and decided not to protest.",未知
"""Shall I let the Master know you've arrived, my lord?""",未知
"""No harm in that.",未知
"You might bring me some coffee.""",未知
"""Very good, my lord.""",未知
"The Butler bowed and hastened out, his daemon trotting submissively at his heels.",未知
"Lyra's uncle moved across to the fire and stretched his arms high above his head, yawning like a lion.",未知
He was wearing traveling clothes.,未知
"Lyra was reminded, as she always was when she saw him again, of how much he frightened her.",未知
There was no question now of creeping out unnoticed: she'd have to sit tight and hope.,there be句型
"Lord Asriel's daemon, a snow leopard, stood behind him.",未知
"""Are you going to show the projections in here?""",未知
she said quietly.,未知
"""Yes.",未知
It'll create less fuss than moving to the lecture theater.,未知
They'll want to see the specimens too; I'll send for the Porter in a minute.,未知
"This is a bad time, Stelmaria.""",未知
"""You should rest.""",未知
"He stretched out in one of the armchairs, so that Lyra could no longer see his face.",未知
"""Yes, yes.",未知
I should also change my clothes.,未知
There's probably some ancient etiquette that allows them to fine me a dozen bottles for coming in here dressed improperly.,未知
I should sleep for three days.,未知
"The fact remains that-""
There was a knock, and the Butler came in with a silver tray bearing a coffeepot and a cup.",未知
"""Thank you, Wren,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""Is that the Tokay I can see on the table?""",未知
"""The Master ordered it decanted especially for you, my I lord,"" said the Butler.",未知
"""There are only three dozen bottles left I of the'98.""",未知
"""All good things pass away.",未知
Leave the tray here beside me.,未知
"Oh, ask the Porter to send up the two cases I left in the Lodge, would you?""",未知
"""Here, my lord?""",未知
"""Yes, here, man.",未知
"And I shall need a screen and a projecting lantern, also here, also now.""",未知
"The Butler could hardly prevent himself from opening his mouth in surprise, but managed to suppress the question, or the protest.",未知
"""Wren, you're forgetting your place,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""Don't question me; just do as I tell you.""",未知
"""Very good, my lord,"" said the Butler.",未知
"""If I may suggest it, I should perhaps let Mr. Cawson know what you're planning, my lord, or else he'll be somewhat taken aback, if you see what I mean.""",未知
"""Yes.",未知
"Tell him, then.""",未知
Mr. Cawson was the Steward.,未知
There was an old and well-established rivalry between him and the Butler.,there be句型
"The Steward was the superior, but the Butler had more opportunities to ingratiate himself with the Scholars, and made full use of them.",未知
He would be delighted to have this chance of showing the Steward that he knew more about what was going on in the Retiring Room.,未知
He bowed and left.,未知
"Lyra watched as her uncle poured a cup of coffee, drained it at once, and poured another before sipping more slowly.",未知
She was agog: cases of specimens?,未知
A projecting lantern?,未知
What did he have to show the Scholars that was so urgent and important?,特殊疑问句
Then Lord Asriel stood up and turned away from the fire.,未知
"She saw him fully, and marveled at the contrast he made with the plump Butler, the stooped and languid Scholars.",主谓宾
"Lord Asriel was a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seemed to flash and glitter with savage laughter.",未知
"It was a face to be dominated by, or to fight: never a face to patronize or pity.",未知
"All his movements were large and perfectly balanced, like those of a wild animal, and when he appeared in a room like this, he seemed a wild animal held in a cage too small for it.",未知
At the moment his expression was distant and preoccupied.,未知
"His daemon came close and leaned her head on his waist, and he looked down at her unfathomably before turning away and walking to the table.",未知
"Lyra suddenly felt her stomach lurch, for Lord Asriel had taken the stopper from the decanter of Tokay, and was pouring a glass.",未知
"""No!""",未知
The quiet cry came before she could hold it back.,未知
Lord Asriel heard and turned at once.,未知
"""Who's there?""",未知
She couldn't help herself.,未知
She tumbled out of the wardrobe and scrambled up to snatch the glass from his hand.,未知
"The wine flew out, splashing on the edge of the table and the carpet, and then the glass fell and smashed.",未知
He seized her wrist and twisted hard.,主谓宾
"""Lyra!",未知
"What the hell are you doing?""",未知
"""Let go of me and I'll tell you!""",未知
"""I'll break your arm first.",未知
"How dare you come in here?""",未知
"""I've just saved your life!""",未知
"They were still for a moment, the girl twisted in pain but grimacing to prevent herself from crying out louder, the man bent over her frowning like thunder.",未知
"""What did you say?""",未知
he said more quietly.,未知
"""That wine is poisoned,"" she muttered between clenched teeth.",未知
"""I saw the Master put some powder in it.""",未知
He let go.,未知
"She sank to the floor, and Pantalaimon fluttered anxiously to her shoulder.",未知
"Her uncle looked down with a restrained fury, and she didn't dare meet his eyes.",未知
"""I came in just to see what the room was like,"" she said.",未知
"""I know I shouldn't have.",未知
"But I was going to go out before anyone came in, except that I heard the Master coming and got ^	trapped.",未知
The wardrobe was the only place to hide.,未知
And I saw him put the powder in the wine.,未知
"If I hadn't...""  
There was a knock on the door.",未知
"""That'll be the Porter,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""Back in the wardrobe.",未知
"If I hear the slightest noise, I'll make you wish you were dead.""",未知
"She darted back there at once, and no sooner had she pulled the door shut than Lord Asriel called, ""Come in.""",未知
"As he'd said, it was the Porter.",未知
"""In here, my lord?""",未知
"Lyra saw the old man standing doubtfully in the doorway, and behind him, the corner of a large wooden box.",未知
"""That's right, Shuter,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""Bring them both in and put them down by the table.""",未知
"Lyra relaxed a little, and allowed herself to feel the pain in her shoulder and wrist.",未知
"It might have been enough to make her cry, if she was the sort of girl who cried.",未知
Instead she gritted her teeth and moved the arm gently until it felt looser.,未知
Then came a crash of glass and the glug of spilled liquid.,未知
"""Damn you, Shuter, you careless old fool!",未知
"Look what you've done!""",未知
"Lyra could see, just.",未知
"Her uncle had managed to knock the
decanter of Tokay off the table, and made it look as if the Porter had done it.",未知
The old man put the box down carefully and began to apologize.,未知
"""I'm truly sorry, my lord-I must have been closer than I thought-""
""Get something to clear this mess up.",未知
"Go on, before it soaks into the carpet!""",未知
The Porter hurried out.,未知
Lord Asriel moved closer to the wardrobe and spoke in an undertone.,未知
"""Since you're in there, you can make yourself useful.",未知
Watch the Master closely when he comes in.,未知
"If you tell me something interesting about him, I'll keep you from getting further into the trouble you're already in.",未知
"Understand?""",未知
"""Yes, Uncle.""",未知
"""Make a noise in there and I won't help you.",未知
"You're on your own.""",未知
He moved away and stood with his back to the fire again as the Porter came back with a brush and dustpan for the glass and a bowl and cloth.,未知
"""I can only say once again, my lord, I do most earnestly beg your pardon; I don't know what-""
""Just clear up the mess.""",未知
"As the Porter began to mop the wine from the carpet, the Butler knocked and came in with Lord Asriel's manservant, a man called Thorold.",未知
They were carrying between them a heavy case of polished wood with brass handles.,未知
They saw what the Porter was doing and stopped dead.,未知
"""Yes, it was the Tokay,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""Too bad.",未知
Is that the lantern?,未知
"Set it up by the wardrobe, Thorold, if you would.",未知
"I'll have the screen up at the other end.""",未知
"Lyra realized that she would be able to see the screen and whatever was on it through the crack in the door, and wondered whether her uncle had arranged it like that for the purpose.",未知
"Under the noise the manservant made unrolling the stiff linen and setting it up on its frame, she whispered:
""See?",未知
"It was worth coming, wasn't it?""",未知
"""It might be,"" Pantalaimon said austerely, in his tiny moth voice.",未知
"""And it might not.""",未知
Lord Asriel stood by the fire sipping the last of the coffee and watching darkly as Thorold opened the case of the projecting lantern and uncapped the lens before checking the oil tank.,未知
"""There's plenty of oil, my lord,"" he said.",未知
"""Shall I send for a technician to operate it?""",未知
"""No.",未知
I'll do it myself.,未知
"Thank you, Thorold.",未知
"Have they finished dinner yet, Wren?""",未知
"""Very nearly, I think, my lord,"" replied the Butler.",未知
"""If I understand Mr. Cawson aright, the Master and his guests won't be disposed to linger once they know you're here.",未知
"Shall I take the coffee tray?""",未知
"""Take it and go.""",未知
"""Very good, my lord.""",未知
"With a slight bow, the Butler took the tray and left, and Thorold went with him.",未知
"As soon as the door closed, Lord Asriel looked across the room directly at the wardrobe, and Lyra felt the force of his glance almost as if it had physical form, as if it were an arrow or a spear.",未知
Then he looked away and spoke softly to his dasmon.,未知
"She came to sit calmly at his side, alert and elegant and dangerous, her tawny eyes surveying the room before turning, like his black ones, to the door from the hall as the handle turned.",未知
"Lyra couldn't see the door, but she heard an intake of breath as the first man came in.",未知
"TWO 
THE IDEA OF NORTH


""Master,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""Yes, I'm back.",未知
"Do bring in your guests; I've got something very interesting to show you.""",未知
"""Lord Asriel,"" said the Master heavily, and came forward to shake his hand.",未知
"From her hiding place Lyra watched the Master's eyes, and indeed, they flicked toward the table for a second, where the Tokay had been.",未知
"""Master,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""I came too late to disturb your dinner, so I made myself at home in here.",未知
"Hello, Sub-Rector.",未知
Glad to see you looking so well.,未知
Excuse my rough appearance; I've only just landed.,未知
"Yes, Master, the Tokay's gone.",未知
I think you're standing in it.,主谓宾
"The Porter knocked it off the table, but it was my fault.",未知
"Hello, Chaplain.",未知
"I read your latest paper with great interest.""",未知
"He moved away with the Chaplain, leaving Lyra with a clear view of the Master's face.",未知
"It was impassive, but the daemon on his shoulder was shuffling her feathers and moving restlessly from foot to foot.",未知
"Lord Asriel was already dominating the room, and although he was careful to be courteous to the Master in the Master's own territory, it was clear where the power lay.",未知
"The Scholars greeted the visitor and moved into the room, some sitting around the table, some in the armchairs, and soon a buzz of conversation filled the air.",未知
"Lyra could see that they were powerfully intrigued by the wooden case, the screen, and the lantern.",未知
"She knew the Scholars well: the Librarian, the Sub-Rector, the Enquirer, and the rest; they were men who had been around her all her life, taught her, chastised her, consoled her, given her little presents, chased her away from the fruit trees in the garden; they were all she had for a family.",未知
"They might even have felt like a family if she knew what a family was, though if she did, she'd have been more likely to feel that about the College servants.",未知
"The Scholars had more important things to do than attend to the affections of a half-wild, half-civilized girl, left among them by chance.",未知
The Master lit the spirit lamp under the little silver chafing dish and heated some butter before cutting half a dozen poppy heads open and tossing them in.,未知
"Poppy was always served after a feast: it clarified the mind and stimulated the tongue, and made for rich conversation.",未知
It was traditional for the Master to cook it himself.,未知
"Under the sizzle of the frying butter and the hum of talk, Lyra shifted around to find a more comfortable position for herself.",未知
With enormous care she took one of the robes-a full-length fur-off its hanger and laid it on the floor of the wardrobe.,未知
"""You should have used a scratchy old one,"" whispered Pantalaimon.",未知
"""If you get too comfortable, you'll go to sleep.""",未知
"""If I do, it's your job to wake me up,"" she replied.",未知
She sat and listened to the talk.,未知
"Mighty dull talk it was, too; almost all of it politics, and London politics at that, nothing exciting about Tartars.",未知
"The smells of frying poppy and smoke-leaf drifted pleasantly in through the wardrobe door, and more than once Lyra found herself nodding.",未知
But finally she heard someone rap on the table.,未知
"The voices fell silent, and then the Master spoke.",未知
"""Gentlemen,"" he said.",未知
"""I feel sure I speak for all of us when I bid Lord Asriel welcome.",未知
"His visits are rare but always immensely valuable, and I understand he has something of particular interest to show us tonight.",未知
"This is a time of high political tension, as we are all aware; Lord Asriel's presence is required early tomorrow morning in White Hall, and a train is waiting with steam up ready to carry him to London as soon as we have finished our conversation here; so we must use our time wisely.",未知
"When he has finished speaking to us, I imagine there will be some questions.",未知
Please keep them brief and to the point.,主谓宾
"Lord Asriel, would you like to begin?""",未知
"""Thank you, Master,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""To start with, I have a few slides to show you.",未知
"Sub-Rector, you can see best from here, I think.",未知
"Perhaps the Master would like to take the chair near the wardrobe?""",未知
Lyra marveled at her uncle's skill.,未知
"The old Sub-Rector was nearly blind, so it was courteous to make room for him nearer the screen, and his moving forward meant that the Master would be sitting next to the Librarian, only a matter of a yard or so from where Lyra was crouched in the wardrobe.",未知
"As the Master settled in the armchair, Lyra heard him murmur:
""The devil!",未知
"He knew about the wine, I'm sure of it.""",未知
"The Librarian murmured back, ""He's going to ask for funds.",未知
"If he forces a vote-""
""If he does that, we must just argue against, with all the eloquence we have.""",未知
The lantern began to hiss as Lord Asriel pumped it hard.,未知
"Lyra moved slightly so that she could see the screen, where a brilliant white circle had begun to glow.",未知
"Lord Asriel called, ""Could someone turn the lamp down?""",未知
"One of the Scholars got up to do that, and the room darkened.",未知
"Lord Asriel began:
""As some of you know, I set out for the North twelve months ago on a diplomatic mission to the King of Lapland.",未知
"At least, that's what I pretended to be doing.",未知
"In fact, my real aim was to go further north still, right on to the ice, in fact, to try and discover what had happened to the Grumman expedition.",未知
One of Grumman's last messages to the academy in Berlin spoke of a certain natural phenomenon only seen in the lands of the North.,未知
I was determined to investigate that as well as find out what I could about Grumman.,未知
"But the first picture I'm going to show you isn't directly about either of those things.""",未知
And he put the first slide into the frame and slid it behind the lens.,未知
A circular photogram in sharp black and white appeared on the screen.,未知
"It had been taken at night under a full moon, and it showed a wooden hut in the middle distance, its walls dark against the snow that surrounded it and lay thickly on the roof.",未知
"Beside the hut stood an array of philosophical instruments, which looked to Lyra's eye like something from the Anbaric Park on the road to Yarnton: aerials, wires, porcelain insulators, all glittering in the moonlight and thickly covered in frost.",未知
"A man in furs, his face hardly visible in the deep hood of his garment, stood in the foreground, with his hand raised as if in greeting.",未知
To one side of him stood a smaller figure.,未知
The moonlight bathed everything in the same pallid gleam.,未知
"""That photogram was taken with a standard silver nitrate emulsion,"" Lord Asriel said.",未知
"""I'd like you to look at another one, taken from the same spot only a minute later, with a new specially prepared emulsion.""",未知
He lifted out the first slide and dropped another into the frame.,未知
This was much darker; it was as if the moonlight had been filtered out.,未知
"The horizon was still visible, with the dark shape of the hut and its light snow-covered roof standing out, but the complexity of the instruments was hidden in darkness.",未知
"But the man had altogether changed: he was bathed in light, and a fountain of glowing particles seemed to be streaming from his upraised hand.",未知
"""That light,"" said the Chaplain, ""is it going up or coming down?""",未知
"""It's coming down,"" said Lord Asriel, ""but it isn't light.",未知
"It's Dust.""",未知
"Something in the way he said it made Lyra imagine dust with a capital letter, as if this wasn't ordinary dust.",未知
"The reaction of the Scholars confirmed her feeling, because Lord Asriel's words caused a sudden collective silence, followed by gasps of incredulity.",未知
"""But how-""
""Surely-""
""It can't-""
""Gentlemen!""",未知
came the voice of the Chaplain.,未知
"""Let Lord Asriel explain.""",未知
"""It's Dust,"" Lord Asriel repeated.",未知
"""It registered as light on the plate because particles of Dust affect this emulsion as photons affect silver nitrate emulsion.",未知
It was partly to test it that my expedition went north in the first place.,未知
"As you see, the figure of the man is perfectly visible.",未知
"Now I'd like you to look at the shape to his left.""",未知
He indicated the blurred shape of the smaller figure.,未知
"""I thought that was the man's daemon,"" said the Enquirer.",未知
"""No.",未知
His daemon was at the time coiled around his neck in the form of a snake.,未知
"That shape you can dimly see is a child.""",未知
"""A severed child-?""",未知
"said someone, and the way he stopped showed that he knew this was something that shouldn't have been voiced.",未知
There was an intense silence.,there be句型
"Then Lord Asriel said calmly, ""An entire child.",未知
"Which, given the nature of Dust, is precisely the point, is it not?""",未知
No one spoke for several seconds.,未知
Then came the voice of the Chaplain.,未知
"""Ah,"" he said, like a thirsty man who, having just drunk deeply, puts down the glass to let out the breath he has held while drinking.",未知
"""And the streams of Dust...""
""-Come from the sky, and bathe him in what looks like light.",未知
You may examine this picture as closely as you wish: I'll leave it behind when I go.,未知
I'm showing it to you now to demonstrate the effect of this new emulsion.,未知
"Now I'd like to show you another picture.""",未知
He changed the slide.,未知
"The next picture was also taken at night, but this time without moonlight.",未知
"It showed a small group of tents in the foreground, dimly outlined against the low horizon, and beside them an untidy heap of wooden boxes and a sledge.",未知
But the main interest of the picture lay in the sky.,未知
"Streams and veils of light hung like curtains, looped and festooned on invisible hooks hundreds of miles high or blowing out sideways in the stream of some unimaginable wind.",未知
"""What is that?""",未知
said the voice of the Sub-Rector.,未知
"""It's a picture of the Aurora.""",未知
"""It's a very fine photogram,"" said the Palmerian Professor.",未知
"""One of the best I've seen.""",未知
"""Forgive my ignorance,"" said the shaky voice of the old Precentor, ""but if I ever knew what the Aurora was, I have forgotten.",未知
"Is it what they call the Northern Lights?""",未知
"""Yes.",未知
It has many names.,未知
"It's composed of storms of charged particles and solar rays of intense and extraordinary strength-invisible in themselves, but causing this luminous radiation when they interact with the atmosphere.",未知
"If there'd been time, I would have had this slide tinted to show you the colors; pale green and rose, for the most part, with a tinge of crimson along the lower edge of that curtain-like formation.",未知
This is taken with ordinary emulsion.,未知
"Now I'd like you to look at a picture taken with the special emulsion.""",未知
He took out the slide.,未知
"Lyra heard the Master say quietly, ""If he forces a vote, we could try to invoke the residence clause.",未知
"He hasn't been resident in the College for thirty weeks out of the last fifty-two.""",未知
"""He's already got the Chaplain on his side..."" the Librarian murmured in reply.",未知
Lord Asriel put a new slide in the lantern frame.,未知
It showed the same scene.,未知
"As with the previous pair of pictures, many of the features visible by ordinary light were much dimmer in this one, and so were the curtains of radiance in the sky.",未知
"But in the middle of the Aurora, high above the bleak landscape, Lyra could see something solid.",未知
"She pressed her face to the crack to see more clearly, and she could see the Scholars near the screen leaning forward too.",主谓宾
"As she gazed, her wonder grew, because there in the sky was the unmistakable outline of a city: towers, domes, walls...Buildings and streets, suspended in the air!",未知
She nearly gasped with wonder.,未知
"The Cassington Scholar said, ""That looks like...a city.""",未知
"""Exactly so,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"""A city in another world, no doubt?""",未知
"said the Dean, with contempt in his voice.",未知
Lord Asriel ignored him.,未知
"There was a stir of excitement among some of the Scholars, as if, having written treatises on the existence of the unicorn without ever having seen one, they'd been presented with a living example newly captured.",there be句型
"""Is this the Barnard-Stokes business?""",未知
said the Palmerian Professor.,未知
"""It is, isn't it?""",未知
"""That's what I want to find out,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
He stood to one side of the illuminated screen.,未知
"Lyra could see his dark eyes searching among the Scholars as they peered up at the slide of the Aurora, and the green glow of his demon's eyes beside him.",未知
"All the venerable heads were craning forward, their spectacles glinting; only the Master and the Librarian leaned back in their chairs, with their heads close together.",未知
"The Chaplain was saying, ""You said you were searching for news of the Grumman expedition, Lord Asriel.",未知
"Was Dr. Grumman investigating this phenomenon too?""",未知
"""I believe he was, and I believe he had a good deal of information about it.",未知
"But he won't be able to tell us what it was, because he's dead.""",未知
"""No!""",未知
said the Chaplain.,未知
"""I'm afraid so, and I have the proof here.""",未知
"A ripple of excited apprehension ran round the Retiring Room as, under Lord Asriel's direction, two or three of the younger Scholars carried the wooden box to the front of the room.",未知
"Lord Asriel took out the last slide but left the lantern on, and in the dramatic glare of the circle of light he bent to lever open the box.",未知
Lyra heard the screech of nails coming out of damp wood.,未知
"The Master stood up to look, blocking Lyra's view.",未知
"Her uncle spoke again:
""If you remember, Grumman's expedition vanished eighteen months ago.",未知
The German Academy sent him up there to go as far north as the magnetic pole and make various celestial observations.,未知
It was in the course of that journey that he observed the curious phenomenon we've already seen.,未知
"Shortly after that, he vanished.",未知
It's been assumed that he had an accident and that his body's been lying in a crevasse all this time.,未知
"In fact, there was no accident.""",未知
"""What have you got there?""",未知
said the Dean.,未知
"""Is that a vacuum container?""",未知
Lord Asriel didn't answer at first.,未知
"Lyra heard the snap of metal clips and a hiss as air rushed into a vessel, and then there was a silence.",未知
But the silence didn't last long.,未知
"After a moment or two Lyra heard a confused babble break out: cries of horror, loud protests, voices raised in anger and fear.",未知
"""But what-""
""-hardly human-""
""-it's been-""
""-what's happened to it?""",未知
The Master's voice cut through them all.,未知
"""Lord Asriel, what in God's name have you got there?""",未知
"""This is the head of Stanislaus Grumman,"" said Lord Asriel's voice.",未知
"Over the jumble of voices Lyra heard someone stumble to the door and out, making incoherent sounds of distress.",未知
She wished she could see what they were seeing.,主谓宾
"Lord Asriel said, ""I found his body preserved in the ice off Svalbard.",未知
The head was treated in this way by his killers.,未知
You'll notice the characteristic scalping pattern.,未知
"I think you might be familiar with it, Sub-Rector.""",未知
"The old man's voice was steady as he said, ""I have seen the Tartars do this.",未知
It's a technique you find among the aboriginals of Siberia and the Tungusk.,未知
"From there, of course, it spread into the lands of the Skraelings, though I understand that it is now banned in New Denmark.",未知
"May I examine it more closely, Lord Asriel?""",未知
After a short silence he spoke again.,未知
"""My eyes are not very clear, and the ice is dirty, but it seems to me that there is a hole in the top of the skull.",未知
"Am I right?""",未知
"""You are.""",未知
"""Trepanning?""",未知
"""Exactly.""",未知
That caused a murmur of excitement.,未知
The Master moved out of the way and Lyra could see again.,未知
"The old Sub-Rector, in the circle of light thrown by the lantern, was holding a heavy block of ice up close to his eyes, and Lyra could see the object inside it: a bloody lump barely recognizable as a human head.",未知
"Pantalaimon fluttered around Lyra, his distress affecting her.",未知
"""Hush,"" she whispered.",未知
"""Listen.""",未知
"""Dr. Grumman was once a Scholar of this College,"" said the Dean hotly.",未知
"""To fall into the hands of the Tartars-"" ""But that far north?""",未知
"""They must have penetrated further than anyone imagined!""",未知
"""Did I hear you say you found it near Svalbard?""",未知
said the Dean.,未知
"""That's right.""",未知
"""Are we to understand that the panserbj0rne had anything to do with this?""",未知
"Lyra didn't recognize that word, but clearly the Scholars did.",未知
"""Impossible,"" said the Cassington Scholar firmly.",未知
"""They'd never behave in that manner.""",未知
"""Then you don't know lofur Raknison,"" said the Palmerian Professor, who had made several expeditions himself to the arctic regions.",未知
"""It wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that he had taken to scalping people in the Tartar fashion.""",未知
"Lyra looked again at her uncle, who was watching the Scholars with a glitter of sardonic amusement, and saying nothing.",未知
"""Who is lofur Raknison?""",未知
said someone.,未知
"""The king of Svalbard,"" said the Palmerian Professor.",未知
"""Yes, that's right, one of the panserb)0me.",未知
"He's a usurper, of sorts; tricked his way onto the throne, or so I understand; but a powerful figure, by no means a fool, in spite of his ludicrous affectations-having a palace built of imported marble-setting up what he calls a university-""
""For whom?",未知
"For the bears?""",未知
"said someone else, and every-one laughed.",未知
"But the Palmerian Professor went on: ""For all that, I tell you that lofur Raknison would be capable of doing this to Grumman.",未知
"At the same time, he could be flattered into behaving quite differently, if the need arose.""",未知
"""And you know how, do you, Trelawney?""",未知
said the Dean sneeringly.,未知
"""Indeed I do.",未知
Do you know what he wants above all else?,一般疑问句
Even more than an honorary degree?,未知
He wants a daemon!,未知
"Find a way to give him a daemon, and he'd do anything for you.""",未知
The Scholars laughed heartily.,未知
Lyra was following this with puzzlement; what the Palmerian Professor said made no sense at all.,未知
"Besides, she was impatient to hear more about scalping and the Northern Lights and that mysterious Dust.",未知
"But she was disappointed, for Lord Asriel had finished showing his relics and pictures, and the talk soon turned into a College wrangle about whether or not they should give him some money to fit out another expedition.",未知
"Back and forth the arguments ranged, and Lyra felt her eyes closing.",未知
"Soon she was fast asleep, with Pantalaimon curled around her neck in his favorite sleeping form as an ermine.",未知
She woke up with a start when someone shook her shoulder.,未知
"""Quiet,"" said her uncle.",未知
"The wardrobe door was open, and he was crouched there against the light.",未知
"""They've all gone, but there are still some servants around.",未知
"Go to your bedroom now, and take care that you say nothing about this.""",未知
"""Did they vote to give you the money?""",未知
she said sleepily.,未知
"""Yes.""",未知
"""What's Dust?""",未知

"""If you wanted me to be a spy in the wardrobe, you ought to tell me what I'm spying about.",未知
"Can I see the man's head?""",未知
Pantalaimon's white ermine fur bristled: she felt it tickling her neck.,未知
Lord Asriel laughed shortly.,未知
"""Don't be disgusting,"" he said, and began to pack his slides and specimen box.",未知
"""Did you watch the Master?""",未知
"""Yes, and he looked for the wine before he did anything else.""",未知
"""Good.",未知

"""But where are you going?""",未知
"""Back to the North.",未知
"I'm leaving in ten minutes.""",未知
"""Can I come?""",未知
"He stopped what he was doing, and looked at her as if for the first time.",未知

"Don't argue anymore or I shall be angry.""",未知
And his daemon growled with a deep savage rumble that made Lyra suddenly aware of what it would be like to have teeth meeting in her throat.,未知

The Master and the Librarian were old friends and allies, and it was their habit, after a difficult episode, to take a glass of brantwijn and console each other.",未知
"So after they'd seen Lord Asriel away, they strolled to the Master's lodging and settled in his study with the curtains drawn and the fire refreshed, their daemons in their familiar places on knee or shoulder, and prepared to think through what had just happened.",未知
"""Do you really believe he knew about the wine?""",未知

"Between them both, Charles, I tremble.""",未知
The Librarian was silent in his turn.,未知
"Ever since Pope John Calvin had moved the seat of the Papacy to Geneva and set up the Consistorial Court of Discipline, the Church's power over every aspect of life had been absolute.",未知
"The Papacy itself had been abolished after Calvin's death, and a tangle of courts, colleges, and councils, collectively known as the Magisterium, had grown up in its place.",未知
These agencies were not always united; sometimes a bitter rivalry grew up between them.,未知
"For a large part of the previous century, the most powerful had been the College of Bishops, but in recent years the Consistorial Court of Discipline had taken its place as the most active and the most feared of all the Church's bodies.",未知
"But it was always possible for independent agencies to grow up under the protection of another part of the Magisterium, and the Oblation Board, which the Librarian had referred to, was one of these.",未知

LYRA'S JORDAN 




Jordan College was the grandest and richest of all the colleges in Oxford.",未知
"It was probably the largest, too, though no one knew for certain.",未知
"The buildings, which were grouped around three irregular quadrangles, dated from every period from the early Middle Ages to the mid-eighteenth century.",未知
"It had never been planned; it had grown piecemeal, with past and present overlapping at every spot, and the final effect was one of jumbled and squalid grandeur.",未知
"Some part was always about to fall down, and for five generations the same family, the Parslows, had been employed full time by the College as masons and scaffolders.",未知
"The present Mr. Parslow was teaching his son the craft; the two of them and their three workmen would scramble like industrious termites over the scaffolding they'd erected at the corner of the library, or over the roof of the chapel, and haul up bright new blocks of stone or rolls of shiny lead or balks of timber.",未知
The College owned farms and estates all over England.,未知
"It was said that you could walk from Oxford to Bristol in one direction and London in the other, and never leave Jordan land.",未知
"In every part of the kingdom there were dye works and brick kilns, forests and atomcraft works that paid rent to Jordan, and every quarter-day the bursar and his clerks would tot it all up, announce the total to Concilium, and order a pair of swans for the feast.",未知
"Some of the money was put by for reinvestment-Concilium had just approved the purchase of an office block in Manchester-and the rest was used to pay the Scholars' modest stipends and the wages of the servants (and the Parslows, and the other dozen or so families of craftsmen and traders who served the College), to keep the wine cellar richly filled, to buy books and anbarographs for the immense library that filled one side of the Melrose Quadrangle and extended, burrow-like, for several floors beneath the ground, and, not least, to buy the latest philosophical apparatus to equip the chapel.",未知
"It was important to keep the chapel up to date, because Jordan College had no rival, either in Europe or in New France, as a center of experimental theology.",未知
"Lyra knew that much, at least.",未知
"She was proud of her College's eminence, and liked to boast of it to the various urchins and ragamuffins she played with by the canal or the claybeds; and she regarded visiting Scholars and eminent professors from elsewhere with pitying scorn, because they didn't belong to Jordan and so must know less, poor things, than the humblest of Jordan's under-Scholars.",主谓宾
"As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins.",未知
"She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really.",未知
"Probably the stars had daemons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them.",未知
"Lyra imagined the Chaplain speaking loftily, listening to the star daemons' remarks, and then nodding judiciously or shaking his head in regret.",未知
"But what might be passing between them, she couldn't conceive.",未知
Nor was she particularly interested.,未知
In many ways Lyra was a barbarian.,未知
"What she liked best was clambering over the College roofs with Roger, the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war.",未知
"Just as she was unaware of the hidden currents of politics running below the surface of College affairs, so the Scholars, for their part, would have been unable to see the rich seething stew of alliances and enmities and feuds and treaties which was a child's life in Oxford.",未知

"One enemy was perennial: the brickburners' children, who lived by the claybeds and were despised by collegers and townies alike.",未知
"Last year Lyra and some townies had made a temporary truce and raided the claybeds, pelting the brick-burners' children with lumps of heavy clay and tipping over the soggy castle they'd built, before rolling them over and over in the clinging substance they lived by until victors and vanquished alike resembled a flock of shrieking golems.",未知
The other regular enemy was seasonal.,未知
"The gyptian families, who lived in canal boats, came and went with the spring and autumn fairs, and were always good for a fight.",未知
"There was one family of gyptians in particular, who regularly returned to their mooring in that part of the city known as Jericho, with whom Lyra'd been feuding ever since she could first throw a stone.",there be句型
"When they were last in Oxford, she and Roger and some of the other kitchen boys from Jordan and St. Michael's College had laid an ambush for them, throwing mud at their brightly painted narrowboat until the whole family came out to chase them away-at which point the reserve squad under Lyra raided the boat and cast it off from the bank, to float down the canal, getting in the way of all the other water traffic while Lyra's raiders searched the boat from end to end, looking for the bung.",未知
Lyra firmly believed in this bung.,未知
"If they pulled it out, she assured her troop, the boat would sink at once; but they didn't find it, and had to abandon ship when the gyptians caught them up, to flee dripping and crowing with triumph through the narrow lanes of Jericho.",未知
That was Lyra's world and her delight.,未知
"She was a coarse and greedy little savage, for the most part.",未知
But she always had a dim sense that it wasn't her whole world; that part of her also belonged in the grandeur and ritual of Jordan College; and that somewhere in her life there was a connection with the high world of politics represented by Lord Asriel.,未知
All she did with that knowledge was to give herself airs and lord it over the other urchins.,未知
It had never occurred to her to find out more.,未知
"So she had passed her childhood, like a half-wild cat.",未知
The only variation in her days came on those irregular occasions when Lord Asriel visited the College.,未知
"A rich and powerful uncle was all very well to boast about, but the price of boasting was having to be caught by the most agile Scholar and brought to the Housekeeper to be washed and dressed in a clean frock, following which she was escorted (with many threats) to the Senior Common Room to have tea with Lord Asriel and an invited group of senior Scholars.",未知
She dreaded being seen by Roger.,未知
He'd caught sight of her on one of these occasions and hooted with laughter at this beribboned and pink-frilled vision.,未知
"She had responded with a volley of shrieking curses that shocked the poor Scholar who was escorting her, and in the Senior Common Room she'd slumped mutinously in an armchair until the Master told her sharply to sit up, and then she'd glowered at them all till even the Chaplain had to laugh.",未知
"What happened on those awkward, formal visits never varied.",未知
"After the tea, the Master and the other few Scholars who'd been invited left Lyra and her uncle together, and he called her to stand in front of him and tell him what she'd learned since his last visit.",未知
"And she would mutter whatever she could dredge up about geometry or Arabic or history or anbarology, and he would sit back with one ankle resting on the other knee and watch her inscrutably until her words failed.",未知
"Last year, before his expedition to the North, he'd gone on to say, ""And how do you spend your time when you're not diligently studying?""",未知
"And she mumbled, ""I just play.",未知
Sort of around the College.,未知
"Just...play, really.""",未知
"And he said, ""Let me see your hands, child.""",未知
"She held out her hands for inspection, and he took them and turned them over to look at her fingernails.",未知
"Beside him, his daemon lay sphinxlike on the carpet, swishing her tail occasionally and gazing unblinkingly at Lyra.",未知
"""Dirty,"" said Lord Asriel, pushing her hands away.",未知
"""Don't they make you wash in this place?""",未知
"""Yes,"" she said.",未知
"""But the Chaplain's fingernails are always dirty.",未知
"They're even dirtier than mine.""",未知
"""He's a learned man.",未知
"What's your excuse?""",未知
"""I must've got them dirty after I washed.""",未知
"""Where do you play to get so dirty?""",未知
She looked at him suspiciously.,未知
"She had the feeling that being on the roof was forbidden, though no one had actually said so.",未知
"""In some of the old rooms,"" she said finally.",未知
"""And where else?""",未知
"""In the claybeds, sometimes.""",未知
"""And?""",未知
"""Jericho and Port Meadow.""",未知
"""Nowhere else?""",未知
"""No.""",未知
"""You're a liar.",未知
"I saw you on the roof only yesterday.""",未知
She bit her lip and said nothing.,主谓宾
He was watching her sardonically.,未知
"""So, you play on the roof as well,"" he went on.",未知
"""Do you ever go into the library?""",未知
"""No.",未知
"I found a rook on the library roof, though,"" she went on.",未知
"""Did you?",未知
"Did you catch it?""",未知
"""It had a hurt foot.",未知
I was going to kill it and roast it but Roger said we should help it get better.,未知
"So we gave it scraps of food and some wine and then it got better and flew away.""",未知
"""Who's Roger?""",未知
"""My friend.",未知
"The kitchen boy.""",未知
"""I see.",未知
"So you've been all over the roof-""
""Not all over.",未知
You can't get onto the Sheldon Building because you have to jump up from Pilgrim's Tower across a gap.,未知
"There's a skylight that opens onto it, but I'm not tall enough to reach it.""",未知
"""You've been all over the roof except the Sheldon Building.",未知
"What about underground?""",未知
"""Underground?""",未知
"""There's as much College below ground as there is above it.",未知
I'm surprised you haven't found that out.,未知
"Well, I'm going in a minute.",未知
You look healthy enough.,未知
"Here.""",未知
"He fished in his pocket and drew out a handful of coins, from which he gave her five gold dollars.",未知
"""Haven't they taught you to say thank you?""",未知
he said.,未知
"""Thank you,"" she mumbled.",未知
"""Do you obey the Master?""",未知
"""Oh, yes.""",未知
"""And respect the Scholars?""",未知
"""Yes.""",未知
Lord Asriel's daemon laughed softly.,未知
"It was the first sound she'd made, and Lyra blushed.",未知
"""Go and play, then,"" said Lord Asriel.",未知
"Lyra turned and darted to the door with relief, remembering to turn and blurt out a ""Goodbye.""",未知
"So Lyra's life had been, before the day when she decided to hide in the Retiring Room, and first heard about Dust.",未知
And of course the Librarian was wrong in saying to the Master that she wouldn't have been interested.,未知
She would have listened eagerly now to anyone who could tell her about Dust.,未知
"She was to hear a great deal more about it in the months to come, and eventually she would know more about Dust than anyone in the world; but in the meantime, there was all the rich life of Jordan still being lived around her.",未知
And in any case there was something else to think about.,未知
"A rumor had been filtering through the streets for some weeks: a rumor that made some people laugh and others grow silent, as some people scoff at ghosts and others fear them.",未知
"For no reason that anyone could imagine, children were beginning to disappear.",未知
"*	*	*

It would happen like this.",未知
"East along the great highway of the River Isis, thronged with slow-moving brick barges and asphalt boats and corn tankers, way down past Henley and Maidenhead to Teddington, where the tide from the German Ocean reaches, and further down still: to Mortlake, past the house of the great magician Dr. Dee; past Falkeshall, where the pleasure gardens spread out bright with fountains and banners by day, with tree lamps and fireworks by night; past White Hall Palace, where the king holds his weekly council of state; past the Shot Tower, dropping its endless drizzle of molten lead into vats of murky water; further down still, to where the river, wide and filthy now, swings in a great curve to the south.",未知
"This is Limehouse, and here is the child who is going to disappear.",未知
He is called Tony Makarios.,未知
"His mother thinks he's nine years old, but she has a poor memory that the drink has rotted; he might be eight, or ten.",未知
"His surname is Greek, but like his age, that is a guess on his mother's part, because he looks more Chinese than Greek, and there's Irish and Skraeling and Lascar in him from his mother's side too.",未知
"Tony's not very bright, but he has a sort of clumsy tenderness that sometimes prompts him to give his mother a rough hug and plant a sticky kiss on her cheeks.",未知
"The poor woman is usually too fuddled to start such a procedure herself; but she responds warmly enough, once she realizes what's happening.",未知
At the moment Tony is hanging about the market in Pie Street.,未知
He's hungry.,未知
"It's early evening, and he won't get fed at home.",未知
"He's got a shilling in his pocket that a soldier gave him for taking a message to his best girl, but Tony's not going to waste that on food, when you can pick up so much for nothing.",未知
"So he wanders through the market, between the old-clothes stalls and the fortune-paper stalls, the fruitmongers and the fried-fish seller, with his little daemon on his shoulder, a sparrow, watching this way and that; and when a stall holder and her daemon are both looking elsewhere, a brisk chirp sounds, and Tony's hand shoots out and returns to his loose shirt with an apple or a couple of nuts, and finally with a hot pie.",未知
"The stall holder sees that, and shouts, and her cat daemon leaps, but Tony's sparrow is aloft and Tony himself halfway down the street already.",未知
"Curses and abuse go with him, but not far.",未知
"He stops running at the steps of St. Catherine's Oratory, where he sits down and takes out his steaming, battered prize, leaving a trail of gravy on his shirt.",未知
And he's being watched.,未知
"A lady in a long yellow-red fox-fur coat, a beautiful young lady whose dark hair falls, shining delicately, under the shadow of her fur-lined hood, is standing in the doorway of the oratory, half a dozen steps above him.",未知
"It might be that a service is finishing, for light comes from the doorway behind her, an organ is playing inside, and the lady is holding a jeweled breviary.",未知
Tony knows nothing of this.,主谓宾
"His face contentedly deep in the pie, his toes curled inward and his bare soles together, he sits and chews and swallows while his daemon becomes a mouse and grooms her whiskers.",未知
The young lady's daemon is moving out from beside the fox-fur coat.,未知
"He is in the form of a monkey, but no ordinary monkey: his fur is long and silky and of the most deep and lustrous gold.",未知
"With sinuous movements he inches down the steps toward the boy, and sits a step above him.",未知
"Then the mouse senses something, and becomes a sparrow again, cocking her head a fraction sideways, and hops along the stone a step or two.",未知
The monkey watches the sparrow; the sparrow watches the monkey.,未知
The monkey reaches out slowly.,未知
"His little hand is black, his nails perfect horny claws, his movements gentle and inviting.",未知
The sparrow can't resist.,未知
"She hops further, and further, and then, with a little flutter, up on to the monkey's hand.",未知
"The monkey lifts her up, and gazes closely at her before standing and swinging back to his human, taking the sparrow daemon with him.",未知
The lady bends her scented head to whisper.,未知
And then Tony turns.,未知
He can't help it.,未知
"""Ratter!""",未知
"he says, half in alarm, his mouth full.",未知
The sparrow chirps.,未知
It must be safe.,未知
Tony swallows his mouthful and stares.,主谓宾
"""Hello,"" says the beautiful lady.",未知
"""What's your name?""",未知
"""Tony.""",未知
"""Where do you live, Tony?""",未知
"""Clarice Walk.""",未知
"""What's in that pie?""",未知
"""Beefsteak.""",未知
"""Do you like chocolatl?""",未知
"""Yeah!""",未知
"""As it happens, I've got more chocolatl than I can drink myself.",未知
"Will you come and help me drink it?""",未知
He's lost already.,未知
He was lost the moment his slow-witted daemon hopped onto the monkey's hand.,未知
"He follows the beautiful young lady and the golden monkey down Denmark Street and along to Hangman's Wharf, and down King George's Steps to a little green door in the side of a tall warehouse.",未知
"She knocks, the door is opened, they go in, the door is closed.",未知
"Tony will never come out-at least, by that entrance; and he'll never see his mother again.",未知
"She, poor drunken thing, will think he's run away, and when she remembers him, she'll think it was her fault, and sob her sorry heart out.",未知
"*	*	*

Little Tony Makarios wasn't the only child to be caught by the lady with the golden monkey.",未知
"He found a dozen others in the cellar of the warehouse, boys and girls, none older than twelve or so; though since all of them had histories like his, none could be sure of their age.",未知
"What Tony didn't notice, of course, was the factor that they all had in common.",未知
None of the children in that warm and steamy cellar had reached the age of puberty.,未知
"The kind lady saw him settled on a bench against the wall, and provided by a silent serving woman with a mug of chocolatl from the saucepan on the iron stove.",未知
"Tony ate the rest of his pie and drank the sweet hot liquor without taking much notice of his surroundings, and the surroundings took little notice of him: he was too small to be a threat, and too stolid to promise much satisfaction as a victim.",未知
It was another boy who asked the obvious question.,未知
"""Hey, lady!",未知
"What you got us all here for?""",未知
He was a tough-looking wretch with dark chocolatl on his top lip and a gaunt black rat for a daemon.,未知
"The lady was standing near the door, talking to a stout man with the air of a sea captain, and as she turned to answer, she looked so angelic in the hissing naphtha light that all the children fell silent.",未知
"""We want your help,"" she said.",未知
"""You don't mind helping us, do you?""",未知
No one could say a word.,未知
"They all gazed, suddenly shy.",未知
"They had never seen a lady like this; she was so gracious and sweet and kind that they felt they hardly deserved their good luck, and whatever she asked, they'd give it gladly so as to stay in her presence a little longer.",未知
She told them that they were going on a voyage.,主谓宾
"They would be well fed and warmly clothed, and those who wanted to could send messages back to their families to let them know they were safe.",未知
"Captain Magnusson would take them on board his ship very soon, and then when the tide was right, they'd sail out to sea and set a course for the North.",未知
"Soon those few who did want to send a message to what-ever home they had were sitting around the beautiful lady as she wrote a few lines at their dictation and, having let them scratch a clumsy X at the foot of the page, folded it into a scented envelope and wrote the address they told her.",未知
"Tony would have liked to send something to his mother, but he had a realistic idea of her ability to read it.",未知
"He plucked at the lady's fox-fur sleeve and whispered that he'd like her to tell his mum where he was going, and all, and she bent her gracious head close enough to his malodorous little body to hear, and stroked his head and promised to pass the message on.",未知
Then the children clustered around to say goodbye.,未知
"The golden monkey stroked all their daemons, and they all touched the fox fur for luck, or as if they were drawing some strength or hope or goodness out of the lady, and she bade them all farewell and saw them in the care of the bold captain on board a steam launch at the jetty.",未知
"The sky was dark now, the river a mass of bobbing lights.",未知
The lady stood on the jetty and waved till she could see their faces no more.,未知
"Then she turned back inside, with the golden monkey nestled in her breast, and threw the little bundle of letters into the furnace before leaving the way she had come.",未知
"Children from the slums were easy enough to entice away, but eventually people noticed, and the police were stirred into reluctant action.",未知
For a while there were no more bewitchings.,未知
"But a rumor had been born, and little by little it changed and grew and spread, and when after a while a few children disappeared in Norwich, and then Sheffield, and then Manchester, the people in those places who'd heard of the disappearances elsewhere added the new vanishings to the story and gave it new strength.",未知
And so the legend grew of a mysterious group of enchanters who spirited children away.,未知
"Some said their leader was a beautiful lady, others said a tall man with red eyes, while a third story told of a youth who laughed and sang to his victims so that they followed him like sheep.",未知
"As for where they took these lost children, no two stories agreed.",未知
"Some said it was to Hell, under the ground, to Fairyland.",未知
Others said to a farm where the children were kept and fattened for the table.,未知
Others said that the children were kept and sold as slaves to rich Tartars....And so on.,未知
But one thing on which everyone agreed was the name of these invisible kidnappers.,未知
"They had to have a name, or not be referred to at all, and talking about them-especially if you were safe and snug at home, or in Jordan College-was delicious.",未知
"And the name that seemed to settle on them, without anyone's knowing why, was the Gobblers.",未知
"""Don't stay out late, or the Gobblers'11 get you!""",未知
"""My cousin in Northampton, she knows a woman whose little boy was took by the Gobblers....""
""The Gobblers've been in Stratford.",未知
"They say they're coming south!""",未知
"And, inevitably:
""Let's play kids and Gobblers!""",未知
"So said Lyra to Roger, one rainy afternoon when they were alone in the dusty attics.",未知
He was her devoted slave by this time; he would have followed her to the ends of the earth.,主谓宾
"""How d'you play that?""",未知
"""You hide and I find you and slice you open, right, like the Gobblers do.""",未知
"""You don't know what they do.",未知
"They might not do that at all.""",未知
"""You're afraid of 'em,"" she said.",未知
"""I can tell.""",未知
"""I en't.",未知
"I don't believe in 'em anyway.""",未知
"""I do,"" she said decisively.",未知
"""But I en't afraid either.",未知
I'd just do what my uncle done last time he came to Jordan.,未知
I seen him.,未知
"He was in the Retiring Room and there was this guest who weren't polite, and my uncle just give him a hard look and the man fell dead on the spot, with all foam and froth round his mouth.""",未知
"""He never,"" said Roger doubtfully.",未知
"""They never said anything about that in the kitchen.",未知
"Anyway, you en't allowed in the Retiring Room.""",未知
"'""Course not.",未知
They wouldn't tell servants about a thing like that.,未知
"And I have been in the Retiring Room, so there.",未知
"Anyway, my uncle's always doing that.",未知
He done it to some Tartars when they caught him once.,未知
"They tied him up and they was going to cut his guts out, but when the first man come up with the knife, my uncle just looked at him, and he fell dead, so another one come up and he done the same to him, and finally there was only one left.",主谓宾
"My uncle said he'd leave him alive if he untied him, so he did, and then my uncle killed him anyway just to teach him a lesson.""",未知
"Roger was less sure about that than about Gobblers, but the story was too good to waste, so they took it in turns to be Lord Asriel and the expiring Tartars, using sherbet dip for the foam.",未知
"However, that was a distraction; Lyra was still intent on playing Gobblers, and she inveigled Roger down into the wine cellars, which they entered by means of the Butler's spare set of keys.",未知
"Together they crept through the great vaults where the College's Tokay and Canary, its Burgundy, its brantwijn were lying under the cobwebs of ages.",未知
"Ancient stone arches rose above them supported by pillars as thick as ten trees, irregular flagstones lay underfoot, and on all sides were ranged rack upon rack, tier upon tier, of bottles and barrels.",未知
It was fascinating.,未知
"With Gobblers forgotten again, the two children tiptoed from end to end holding a candle in trembling fingers, peering into every dark corner, with a single question growing more urgent in Lyra's mind every moment: what did the wine taste like?",未知
There was an easy way of answering that.,there be句型
"Lyra-over Roger's fervent protests-picked out the oldest, twistiest, greenest bottle she could find, and, not having anything to extract the cork with, broke it off at the neck.",未知
"Huddled in the furthest corner, they sipped at the heady crimson liquor, wondering when they'd become drunk, and how they'd tell when they were.",未知
"Lyra didn't like the taste much, but she had to admit how grand and complicated it was.",未知
"The funniest thing was watching their two daemons, who seemed to be getting more and more muddled: falling over, giggling senselessly, and changing shape to look like gargoyles, each trying to be uglier than the other.",未知
"Finally, and almost simultaneously, the children discovered what it was like to be drunk.",未知
"""Do they like doing this?""",未知
"gasped Roger, after vomiting copiously.",未知
"""Yes,"" said Lyra, in the same condition.",未知
"""And so do I,"" she added stubbornly.",未知
Lyra learned nothing from that episode except that playing Gobblers led to interesting places.,主谓宾
"She remembered her uncle's words in their last interview, and began to explore underground, for what was above ground was only a small fraction of the whole.",主谓宾
"Like some enormous fungus whose root system extended over acres, Jordan (finding itself jostling for space above ground with St. Michael's College on one side, Gabriel College on the other, and the University Library behind) had begun, sometime in the Middle Ages, to spread below the surface.",未知
"Tunnels, shafts, vaults, cellars, staircases had so hollowed out the earth below Jordan and for several hundred yards around it that there was almost as much air below ground as above; Jordan College stood on a sort of froth of stone.",未知
"And now that Lyra had the taste for exploring it, she abandoned her usual haunt, the irregular alps of the College roofs, and plunged with Roger into this netherworld.",未知
"From playing at Gobblers she had turned to hunting them, for what could be more likely than that they were lurking out of sight below the ground?",未知
So one day she and Roger made their way into the crypt below the oratory.,未知
"This was where generations of Masters had been buried, each in his lead-lined oak coffin in niches along the stone walls.",未知
"A stone tablet below each space gave their names:

SIMON LE CLERC, MASTER 1765-1789 CEREBATON 
REQUIESCANT IN PACE


""What's that mean?""",未知
said Roger.,未知
"""The first part's his name, and the last bit's Roman.",未知
And there's the dates in the middle when he was Master.,未知
"And the other name must be his daemon.""",未知
"They moved along the silent vault, tracing the letters of more inscriptions:

FRANCIS LYALL, MASTER 1748-1765   ZOHARIEL
REQUIESCANT IN PACE

ICNATIUS COLE, MASTER 1745-1748  MUSCA
REQUIESCANT IN PACE

On each coffin, Lyra was interested to see, a brass plaque bore a picture of a different being: this one a basilisk, this a serpent, this a monkey.",未知
She realized that they were images of the dead men's daemons.,未知
"As people became adult, their daemons lost the power to change and assumed one shape, keeping it permanently.",未知
"""These coffins' ve got skeletons in ""em!""",未知
whispered Roger.,未知
"""Moldering flesh,"" whispered Lyra.",未知
"""And worms and maggots all twisting about in their eye sockets.""",未知
"""Must be ghosts down here,"" said Roger, shivering pleasantly.",未知
Beyond the first crypt they found a passage lined with stone shelves.,未知
"Each shelf was partitioned off into square sections, and in each section rested a skull.",未知
"Roger's daemon, tail tucked firmly between her legs, shivered against him and gave a little quiet howl.",未知
"""Hush,"" he said.",未知
"Lyra couldn't see Pantalaimon, but she knew his moth form was resting on her shoulder and probably shivering too.",未知
She reached up and lifted the nearest skull gently out of its resting place.,未知
"""What you doing?""",未知
said Roger.,未知
"""You en't supposed to touch em.""",未知
"She turned it over and over, taking no notice.",主谓宾
"Something suddenly fell out of the hole at the base of the skull - fell through her fingers and rang as it hit the floor, and she nearly dropped the skull in alarm.",未知
"""It's a coin!""",未知
"said Roger, feeling for it.",未知
"""Might be treasure!""",未知
He held it up to the candle and they both gazed wide-eyed.,主谓宾
"It was not a coin, but a little disc of bronze with a crudely engraved inscription showing a cat.",未知
"""It's like the ones on the coffins,"" said Lyra.",未知
"""It's his daemon.",未知
"Must be.""",未知
"""Better put it back,"" said Roger uneasily, and Lyra upturned the skull and dropped the disk back into its immemorial resting place before returning the skull to the shelf.",未知
"Each of the other skulls, they found, had its own daemon-coin, showing its owner's lifetime companion still close to him in death.",未知
"""Who d'you think these were when they were alive?""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""Probably Scholars, I reckon.",未知
Only the Masters get coffins.,未知
"There's probably been so many Scholars all down the centuries that there wouldn't be room to bury the whole of 'em, so they just cut their heads off and keep them.",未知
"That's the most important part of 'em anyway.""",未知
"They found no Gobblers, but the catacombs under the oratory kept Lyra and Roger busy for days.",未知
"Once she tried to play a trick on some of the dead Scholars, by switching around the coins in their skulls so they were with the wrong daemons.",未知
"Pantalaimon became so agitated at this that he changed into a bat and flew up and down uttering shrill cries and flapping his wings in her face, but she took no notice: it was too good a joke to waste.",未知
"She paid for it later, though.",未知
"In bed in her narrow room at the top of Staircase Twelve she was visited by a night-ghast, and woke up screaming at the three robed figures who stood at the bedside pointing their bony fingers before throwing back their cowls to show bleeding stumps where their heads should have been.",未知
"Only when Pantalaimon became a lion and roared at them did they retreat, backing away into the substance of the wall until all that was visible was their arms, then their horny yellow-gray hands, then their twitching fingers, then nothing.",未知
"First thing in the morning she hastened down to the catacombs and restored the daemon-coins to their rightful places, and whispered ""Sorry!",未知
"Sorry!""",未知
to the skulls.,未知
"The catacombs were much larger than the wine cellars, but they too had a limit.",未知
"When Lyra and Roger had explored every corner of them and were sure there were no Gobblers to be found there, they turned their attention elsewhere-but not before they were spotted leaving the crypt by the Intercessor, who called them back into the oratory.",未知
"The Intercessor was a plump, elderly man known as Father Heyst.",未知
"It was his job to lead all the College services, to preach and pray and hear confessions.",主谓宾
"When Lyra was younger, he had taken an interest in her spiritual welfare, only to be confounded by her sly indifference and insincere repentances.",未知
"She was not spiritually promising, he had decided.",未知
"When they heard him call, Lyra and Roger turned reluctantly and walked, dragging their feet, into the great musty-smelling dimness of the oratory.",未知
"Candles flickered here and there in front of images of the saints; a faint and distant clatter came from the organ loft, where some repairs were going on; a servant was polishing the brass lectern.",未知
Father Heyst beckoned from the vestry door.,未知
"""Where have you been?""",未知
he said to them.,未知
"""I've seen you come in here two or three times now.",未知
"What are you up to?""",未知
His tone was not accusatory.,未知
He sounded as if he were genuinely interested.,未知
His daemon flicked a lizard tongue at them from her perch on his shoulder.,未知
"Lyra said, ""We wanted to look down in the crypt.""",未知
"""Whatever for?""",未知
"""The...the coffins.",未知
"We wanted to see all the coffins,"" she said.",未知
"""But why?""",未知
She shrugged.,未知
It was her constant response when she was pressed.,主谓宾
"""And you,"" he went on, turning to Roger.",未知
Roger's daemon anxiously wagged her terrier tail to propitiate him.,未知
"""What's your name?""",未知
"""Roger, Father.""",未知
"""If you're a servant, where do you work?""",未知
"""In the kitchen, Father.""",未知
"""Should you be there now?""",未知
"""Yes, Father.""",未知
"""Then be off with you.""",未知
Roger turned and ran.,未知
Lyra dragged her foot from side to side on the floor.,主谓宾

"Having failed to find Gobblers below ground, Lyra took to the streets again.",未知
She was at home there.,未知
"Then, almost when she'd lost interest in them, the Gobblers appeared in Oxford.",未知
The first Lyra heard of it was when a young boy went missing from a gyptian family she knew.,未知
"It was about the time of the horse fair, and the canal basin was crowded with narrowboats and butty boats, with traders and travelers, and the wharves along the waterfront in Jericho were bright with gleaming harness and loud with the clop of hooves and the clamor of bargaining.",未知

"Inspired by the capture of the narrowboat the year before, she intended this time to make a proper voyage before being turned out.",未知
"If she and her cronies from the College kitchens could get as far as Abingdon, they could play havoc with the weir....",未知
But this year there was to be no war.,未知
Something else happened.,未知
"Lyra was sauntering along the edge of the Port Meadow boatyard in the morning sun, without Roger for once (he had been detailed to wash the buttery floor) but with Hugh Lovat and Simon Parslow, passing a stolen cigarette from one to another and blowing out the smoke ostentatiously, when she heard a cry in a voice she recognized.",未知
"""Well, what have you done with him, you half-arsed pillock?""",未知
"It was a mighty voice, a woman's voice, but a woman with lungs of brass and leather.",未知

Lyra was frightened.,未知
"No one worried about a child gone missing for a few hours, certainly not a gyptian: in the tight-knit gyptian boat world, all children were precious and extravagantly loved, and a mother knew that if a child was out of sight, it wouldn't be far from someone else's who would protect it instinctively.",未知

"""So,"" she said, ""sometime in the last two hours there must've been Gobblers here....""
They all looked around, shivering in spite of the warm sun, the crowded wharf, the familiar smells of tar and horses and smokeleaf.",未知
"The trouble was that because no one knew what these Gobblers looked like, anyone might be a Gobbler, as Lyra pointed out to the appalled gang, who were now all under her sway, collegers and gyptians alike.",未知
"""They're bound to look like ordinary people, else they'd be seen at once,"" she explained.",未知
"""If they only came at night, they could look like anything.",未知

"""Let's go and look for 'em!",未知
"And their white truck!""",未知
And that precipitated a swarm.,未知
"Other searchers soon joined the first ones, and before long, thirty or more gyptian children were racing from end to end of the wharves, running in and out of stables, scrambling over the cranes and derricks in the boatyard, leaping over the fence into the wide meadow, swinging fifteen at a time on the old swing bridge over the green water, and running full pelt through the narrow streets of Jericho, between the little brick terraced houses and into the great square-towered oratory of St. Barnabas the Chymist.",未知
"Half of them didn't know what they were looking for, and thought it was just a lark, but those closest to Lyra felt a real fear and apprehension every time they glimpsed a solitary figure down an alley or in the dimness of the oratory: was it a Gobbler?",未知
But of course it wasn't.,未知
"Eventually, with no success, and with the shadow of Billy's real disappearance hanging over them all, the fun faded away.",未知
"As Lyra and the two College boys left Jericho when suppertime neared, they saw the gyptians gathering on the wharf next to where the Costas' boat was moored.",未知
"Some of the women were crying loudly, and the men were standing in angry groups, with all their daemons agitated and rising in nervous flight or snarling at shadows.",未知

She ran across the narrow street and down into the alley where the vans unloaded goods for the covered market.,未知
"This being shutting-up time, there were few vans there now, but a knot of youths stood smoking and talking by the central gate opposite the high stone wall of St. Michael's College.",未知

"Lyra remembered that severed meant ""cut.""",未知
And then something else hit her heart: where was Roger?,未知

"Cousins the manservant showed her in, and pointedly left the door open so that he could see what she was up to from the hall, where he was helping people on with their coats.",未知
"Lyra watched for Mrs. Coulter, but she didn't see her, and then the Master came into the study and shut the door.",未知
He sat down heavily in the armchair by the fireplace.,未知
"His daemon flapped up to the chair back and sat by his head, her old hooded eyes on Lyra.",未知
"The lamp hissed gently as the Master said:
""So, Lyra.",未知
You've been talking to Mrs. Coulter.,未知
"Did you enjoy hearing what she said?""",未知
"""Yes!""",未知
"""She is a remarkable lady.""",未知
"""She's wonderful.",未知
"She's the most wonderful person I've ever met.""",未知
The Master sighed.,未知
"In his black suit and black tie he looked as much like his daemon as anyone could, and suddenly Lyra thought that one day, quite soon, he would be buried in the crypt under the oratory, and an artist would engrave a picture of his daemon on the brass plate for his coffin, and her name would share the space with his.",未知
"""I should have made time before now for a talk with you, Lyra,"" he said after a few moments.",未知
"""I was intending to do so in any case, but it seems that time is further on than I thought.",未知
"You have been safe here in Jordan, my dear.",未知
I think you've been happy.,主谓宾
"You haven't found it easy to obey us, but we are very fond of you, and you've never been a bad child.",未知
"There's a lot of goodness and sweetness in your nature, and a lot of determination.",未知
You're going to need all of that.,未知
"Things are going on in the wide world I would have liked to protect you from-by keeping you here in Jordan, I mean-but that's no longer possible.""",未知
She merely stared.,未知
Were they going to send her away?,特殊疑问句
"""You knew that sometime you'd have to go to school,"" the Master went on.",未知
"""We have taught you some things here, but not well or systematically.",未知
Our knowledge is of a different kind.,未知
"You need to know things that elderly men are not able to teach you, especially at the age you are now.",未知
You must have been aware of that.,未知
You're not a servant's child either; we couldn't put you out to be fostered by a town family.,未知
"They might have cared for you in some ways, but your needs are different.",未知
"You see, what I'm saying to you, Lyra, is that the part of your life that belongs to Jordan College is coming to an end.""",未知
"""No,"" she said, ""no, I don't want to leave Jordan.",未知
I like it here.,主谓宾

"""When you're young, you do think that things last forever.",未知
"Unfortunately, they don't.",未知
"Lyra, it won't be long-a couple of years at most-before you will be a young woman, and not a child anymore.",未知
A young lady.,未知
"And believe me, you'll find Jordan College a far from easy place to live in then.""",未知
"""But it's my home!""",未知
"""It has been your home.",未知
"But now you need something else.""",未知
"""Not school.",未知
"I'm not going to school.""",未知
"""You need female company.",未知
"Female guidance.""",未知
"The word female only suggested female Scholars to Lyra, and she involuntarily made a face.",未知
"To be exiled from the grandeur of Jordan, the splendor and fame of its scholarship, to a dingy brick-built boardinghouse of a college at the northern end of Oxford, with dowdy female Scholars who smelled of cabbage and mothballs like those two at dinner!",未知
"The Master saw her expression, and saw Pantalaimon's polecat eyes flash red.",未知
"He said, ""But suppose it were Mrs.",未知
"Coulter?""",未知
Instantly Pantalaimon's fur changed from coarse brown to downy white.,未知
Lyra's eyes widened.,未知
"""Really?""",未知
"""She is by way of being acquainted with Lord Asriel.",未知

"""Yes!""",未知
She could hardly sit still.,未知
The Master smiled.,未知
"He smiled so rarely that he was out of practice, and anyone watching (Lyra wasn't in a state to notice) would have said it was a grimace of sadness.",未知
"""Well, we had better ask her in to talk about it,"" he said.",未知
"He left the room, and when he came back a minute later with Mrs. Coulter, Lyra was on her feet, too excited to sit.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter smiled, and her daemon bared his white teeth in a grin of implike pleasure.",未知
"As she passed her on the way to the armchair, Mrs. Coulter touched Lyra's hair briefly, and Lyra felt a current of warmth flow into her, and blushed.",未知
"When the Master had poured some brantwijn for her, Mrs. Coulter said, ""So, Lyra, I'm to have an assistant, am I?""",未知
"""Yes,"" said Lyra simply.",未知

"You'll have to learn mathematics, and navigation, and celestial geography.""",未知
"""Will you teach me?""",未知
"""Yes.",未知
"And you'll have to help me by making notes and putting my papers in order and doing various pieces of basic calculation, and so on.",未知

I'll see you at breakfast.,未知
"Goodnight!""",未知
"""Goodnight,"" said Lyra, and, remembering the few manners she had, turned at the door and said, ""Goodnight, Master.""",未知
He nodded.,未知
"""Sleep well,"" he said.",未知
"""And thanks,"" Lyra added to Mrs. Coulter.",未知
"She did sleep, finally, though Pantalaimon wouldn't settle until she snapped at him, when he became a hedgehog out of pique.",未知
It was still dark when someone shook her awake.,未知
"""Lyra-hush-don't start-wake up, child.""",未知
It was Mrs. Lonsdale.,主谓宾
"She was holding a candle, and she bent over and spoke quietly, holding Lyra still with her free hand.",未知
"""Listen.",未知
The Master wants to see you before you join Mrs. Coulter for breakfast.,未知
Get up quickly and run across to the lodging now.,未知
Go into the garden and tap at the French window of the study.,未知
"You understand?""",未知
"Fully awake and on fire with puzzlement, Lyra nodded and slipped her bare feet into the shoes Mrs. Lonsdale put down for her.",未知
"""Never mind washing-that'll do later.",未知
Go straight down and come straight back.,未知
I'll start your packing and have something for you to wear.,未知
"Hurry now.""",未知
The dark quadrangle was still full of the chill night air.,未知
"Overhead the last stars were still visible, but the light from the east was gradually soaking into the sky above the Hall.",未知
"Lyra ran into the Library Garden, and stood for a moment in the immense hush, looking up at the stone pinnacles of the chapel, the pearl-green cupola of the Sheldon Building, the white-painted lantern of the Library.",未知
"Now that she was going to leave these sights, she wondered how much she'd miss them.",未知
Something stirred in the study window and a glow of light shone out for a moment.,未知
She remembered what she had to do and tapped on the glass door.,未知
It opened almost at once.,未知
"""Good girl.",未知
Come in quickly.,未知
"We haven't got long,"" said the Master, and drew the curtain back across the door as soon as she had entered.",未知
He was fully dressed in his usual black.,未知
"""Aren't I going after all?""",未知
Lyra asked.,未知
"""Yes; I can't prevent it,"" said the Master, and Lyra didn't notice at the time what an odd thing that was to say.",未知
"""Lyra, I'm going to give you something, and you must promise to keep it private.",未知
"Will you swear to that?""",未知
"""Yes,"" Lyra said.",未知
He crossed to the desk and took from a drawer a small package wrapped in black velvet.,未知
"When he unfolded the cloth, Lyra saw something like a large watch or a small clock: a thick disk of gold and crystal.",未知
It might have been a compass or something of the sort.,未知
"""What is it?""",未知
she said.,未知
"""It's an alethiometer.",未知
It's one of only six that were ever made.,未知
"Lyra, I urge you again: keep it private.",未知
It would be better if Mrs. Coulter didn't know about it.,未知
"Your uncle-""
""But what does it do?""",未知
"""It tells you the truth.",未知
"As for how to read it, you'll have to learn by yourself.",未知
"Now go-it's getting lighter-hurry back to your room before anyone sees you.""",未知
He folded the velvet over the instrument and thrust it into her hands.,未知
It was surprisingly heavy.,未知
Then he put his own hands on either side of her head and held her gently for a moment.,未知
"She tried to look up at him, and said, ""What were you going to say about Uncle Asriel?""",未知
"""Your uncle presented it to Jordan College some years ago.",未知
"He might-""
Before he could finish, there came a soft urgent knock on the door.",未知
She could feel his hands give an involuntary tremor.,未知
"""Quick now, child,"" he said quietly.",未知
"""The powers of this world are very strong.",未知
"Men and women are moved by tides much fiercer than you can imagine, and they sweep us all up into the current.",未知
"Go well, Lyra; bless you, child, bless you.",未知
"Keep your own counsel.""",未知
"""Thank you, Master,"" she said dutifully.",未知
"Clutching the bundle to her breast, she left the study by the garden door, looking back briefly once to see the Master's daemon watching her from the windowsill.",未知
The sky was lighter already; there was a faint fresh stir in the air.,未知
"""What's that you've got?""",未知
"said Mrs. Lonsdale, closing the battered little suitcase with a snap.",未知
"""The Master gave it me.",未知
"Can't it go in the suitcase?""",未知
"""Too late.",未知
I'm not opening it now.,未知
"It'll have to go in your coat pocket, whatever it is.",未知
"Hurry on down to the buttery; don't keep them waiting....""

It was only after she'd said goodbye to the few servants who were up, and to Mrs. Lonsdale, that she remembered Roger; and then she felt guilty for not having thought of him once since meeting Mrs. Coulter.",未知
How quickly it had all happened!,感叹句
"But no doubt Mrs. Coulter would help her look for him, and she was bound to have powerful friends who could get him back from wherever he'd disappeared to.",未知
He was bound to turn up eventually.,未知
"And now she was on her way to London: sitting next to the window in a zeppelin, no less, with Pantalaimon's sharp little ermine paws digging into her thigh while his front paws rested against the glass he gazed through.",未知
"On Lyra's other side Mrs. Coulter sat working through some papers, but she soon put them away and talked.",未知
Such brilliant talk!,未知
"Lyra was intoxicated; not about the North this time, but about London, and the restaurants and ballrooms, the soirees at embassies or ministries, the intrigues between White Hall and Westminster.",未知
Lyra was almost more fascinated by this than by the changing landscape below the airship.,未知
"What Mrs. Coulter was saying seemed to be accompanied by a scent of grownupness, something disturbing but enticing at the same time: it was the smell of glamour.",未知
"*	*	*

The landing in Falkeshall Gardens, the boat ride across the wide brown river, the grand mansion block on the Embankment where a stout commissionaire (a sort of porter with medals) saluted Mrs. Coulter and winked at Lyra, who sized him up expressionlessly.",未知
"And then the flat...
Lyra could only gasp.",未知
"She had seen a great deal of beauty in her short life, but it was Jordan College beauty, Oxford beauty-grand and stony and masculine.",未知
"In Jordan College, much was magnificent, but nothing was pretty.",未知
"In Mrs. Coulter's flat, everything was pretty.",未知
"It was full of light, for the wide windows faced south, and the walls were covered in a delicate gold-and-white striped wallpaper.",未知
"Charming pictures in gilt frames, an antique looking-glass, fanciful sconces bearing anbaric lamps with frilled shades; and frills on the cushions too, and flowery valances over the curtain rail, and a soft green leaf-pattern carpet underfoot; and every surface was covered, it seemed to Lyra's innocent eye, with pretty little china boxes and shepherdesses and harlequins of porcelain.",未知
Mrs. Coulter smiled at her admiration.,未知
"""Yes, Lyra,"" she said, ""there's such a lot to show you!",未知
Take your coat off and I'll take you to the bathroom.,未知
"You can have a wash, and then we'll have some lunch and go shopping....""
The bathroom was another wonder.",未知
"Lyra was used to washing with hard yellow soap in a chipped basin, where the water that struggled out of the taps was warm at best, and often flecked with rust.",未知
"But here the water was hot, the soap rose-pink and fragrant, the towels thick and cloud-soft.",未知
"And around the edge of the tinted mirror there were little pink lights, so that when Lyra looked into it she saw a softly illuminated figure quite unlike the Lyra she knew.",未知
"Pantalaimon, who was imitating the form of Mrs. Coulter's daemon, crouched on the edge of the basin making faces at her.",未知
She pushed him into the soapy water and suddenly remembered the alethiometer in her coat pocket.,主谓宾
She'd left the coat on a chair in the other room.,未知
"She'd promised the Master to keep it secret from Mrs. Coulter....
Oh, this was confusing.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter was so kind and wise, whereas Lyra had actually seen the Master trying to poison Uncle Asriel.",未知
Which of them did she owe most obedience to?,未知
"She rubbed herself dry hastily and hurried back to the sitting room, where her coat still lay untouched, of course.",主谓宾
"""Ready?""",未知
said Mrs. Coulter.,未知
"""I thought we'd go to the Royal Arctic Institute for lunch.",未知
"I'm one of the very few female members, so I might as well use the privileges I have.""",未知
"Twenty minutes' walk took them to a grand stone-fronted building where they sat in a wide dining room with snowy cloths and bright silver on the tables, and ate calves' liver and bacon.",未知
"""Calves' liver is all right,"" Mrs. Coulter told her, ""and so is seal liver, but if you're stuck for food in the Arctic, you mustn't eat bear liver.",未知
"That's full of a poison that'll kill you in minutes.""",未知
"As they ate, Mrs. Coulter pointed out some of the members at the other tables.",未知
"""D'you see the elderly gentleman with the red tie?",未知
That's Colonel Carborn.,未知
He made the first balloon flight over the North Pole.,未知
And the tall man by the window who's just got up is Dr.,未知
"Broken Arrow.""",未知
"""Is he a Skraeling?""",未知
"""Yes.",未知
"He was the man who mapped the ocean currents in the Great Northern Ocean....""
Lyra looked at them all, these great men, with curiosity and awe.",未知
"They were Scholars, no doubt about that, but they were explorers too.",主谓宾
Dr.,未知
Broken Arrow would know about bear livers; she doubted whether the Librarian of Jordan College would.,未知
"After lunch Mrs. Coulter showed her some of the precious arctic relics in the institute library-the harpoon with which the great whale Grimssdur had been killed; the stone carved with an inscription in an unknown language which was found in the hand of the explorer Lord Rukh, frozen to death in his lonely tent; a fire-striker used by Captain Hudson on his famous voyage to Van Tieren's Land.",未知
"She told the story of each one, and Lyra felt her heart stir with admiration for these great, brave, distant heroes.",未知
And then they went shopping.,未知
"Everything on this extraordinary day was a new experience for Lyra, but shopping was the most dizzying.",未知
"To go into a vast building full of beautiful clothes, where people let you try them on, where you looked at yourself in mirrors...And the clothes were so pretty....Lyra's clothes had come to her through Mrs. Lonsdale, and a lot of them had been handed down and much mended.",未知
"She had seldom had anything new, and when she had, it had been picked for wear and not for looks; and she had never chosen anything for herself.",主谓宾
"And now to find Mrs. Coulter suggesting this, and praising that, and paying for it all, and more...
By the time they'd finished, Lyra was flushed and bright-eyed with tiredness.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter ordered most of the clothes packed up and delivered, and took one or two things with her when she and Lyra walked back to the flat.",未知
"Then a bath, with thick scented foam.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter came into the bathroom to wash Lyra's hair, and she didn't rub and scrape like Mrs. Lonsdale either.",未知
She was gentle.,未知
"Pantalaimon watched with powerful curiosity until Mrs. Coulter looked at him, and he knew what she meant and turned away, averting his eyes modestly from these feminine mysteries as the golden monkey was doing.",未知
He had never had to look away from Lyra before.,未知
"Then, after the bath, a warm drink with milk and herbs; and a new flannel nightdress with printed flowers and a seal' loped hem, and sheepskin slippers dyed soft blue; and then bed.",未知
"So soft, this bed!",未知
"So gentle, the anbaric light on the bed' side table!",未知
"And the bedroom so cozy with little cupboards and a dressing table and a chest of drawers where her new clothes would go, and a carpet from one wall to the other, and pretty curtains covered in stars and moons and planets!",未知
"Lyra lay stiffly, too tired to sleep, too enchanted to question anything.",主谓宾
"When Mrs. Coulter had wished her a soft goodnight and gone out, Pantalaimon plucked at her hair.",未知
"She brushed him away, but he whispered, ""Where's the thing?""",未知
She knew at once what he meant.,未知
"Her old shabby overcoat hung in the wardrobe; a few seconds later, she was back in bed, sitting up cross-legged in the lamplight, with Pantalaimon watching closely as she unfolded the black velvet and looked at what it was the Master had given her.",未知
"""What did he call it?""",未知
she whispered.,未知
"""An alethiometer.""",未知
There was no point in asking what that meant.,there be句型
"It lay heavily in her hands, the crystal face gleaming, the golden body exquisitely machined.",未知
"It was very like a clock, or a compass, for there were hands pointing to places around the dial, but instead of the hours or the points of the compass there were several little pictures, each of them painted with extraordinary precision, as if on ivory with the finest and slenderest sable brush.",未知
She turned the dial around to look at them all.,未知
"There was an anchor; an hourglass surmounted by a skull; a chameleon, a bull, a beehive...Thirty-six altogether, and she couldn't even guess what they meant.",there be句型
"""There's a wheel, look,"" said Pantalaimon.",未知
"""See if you can wind it up.""",未知
"There were three little knurled winding wheels, in fact, and each of them turned one of the three shorter hands, which moved around the dial in a series of smooth satisfying clicks.",there be句型
"You could arrange them to point at any of the pictures, and once they had clicked into position, pointing exactly at the center of each one, they would not move.",未知
"The fourth hand was longer and more slender, and seemed to be made of a duller metal than the other three.",未知
"Lyra couldn't control its movement at all; it swung where it wanted to, like a compass needle, except that it didn't settle.",未知
"""Meter means measure,"" said Pantalaimon.",未知
"""Like thermometer.",未知
"The Chaplain told us that.""",未知
"""Yes, but that's the easy bit,"" she whispered back.",未知
"""What d'you think it's for?""",未知
Neither of them could guess.,未知
"Lyra spent a long time turning the hands to point at one symbol or another (angel, helmet, dolphin; globe, lute, compasses; candle, thunderbolt, horse) and watching the long needle swing on its never-ceasing errant way, and although she understood nothing, she was intrigued and delighted by the complexity and the detail.",未知
"Pantalaimon became a mouse to get closer to it, and rested his tiny paws on the edge, his button eyes bright black with curiosity as he watched the needle swing.",未知
"""What do you think the Master meant about Uncle Asriel?""",未知
she said.,未知
"""Perhaps we've got to keep it safe and give it to him.""",未知
"""But the Master was going to poison him!",未知
Perhaps it's the opposite.,未知
"Perhaps he was going to say don't give it to him.""",未知
"""No,"" Pantalaimon said, ""it was her we had to keep it safe from-""
There was a soft knock on the door.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter said, ""Lyra, I should put the light out if I were you.",未知
"You're tired, and we'll be busy tomorrow.""",未知
Lyra had thrust the alethiometer swiftly under the blankets.,未知
"""All right, Mrs. Coulter,"" she said.",未知
"""Goodnight now.""",未知
"""Goodnight.""",未知
She snuggled down and switched off the light.,未知
"Before she fell asleep, she tucked the alethiometer under the pillow, just in case.",未知
"Five
THE COCKTAIL PARTY




In the days that followed, Lyra went everywhere with Mrs. Coulter, almost as if she were a daemon herself.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter knew a great many people, and they met in all kinds of different places: in the morning there might be a meeting of geographers at the Royal Arctic Institute, and Lyra would sit by and listen; and then Mrs. Coulter might meet a politician or a cleric for lunch in a smart restaurant, and they would be very taken with Lyra and order special dishes for her, and she would learn how to eat asparagus or what sweetbreads tasted like.",未知
"And then in the afternoon there might be more shopping, for Mrs. Coulter was preparing her expedition, and there were furs and oilskins and waterproof boots to buy, as well as sleeping bags and knives and drawing instruments that delighted Lyra's heart.",未知
"After that they might go to tea and meet some ladies, as well dressed as Mrs. Coulter if not so beautiful or accomplished: women so unlike female Scholars or gyptian boat mothers or college servants as almost to be a new sex altogether, one with dangerous powers and qualities such as elegance, charm, and grace.",未知
"Lyra would be dressed up prettily for these occasions, and the ladies would pamper her and include her in their graceful delicate talk, which was all about people: this artist, or that politician, or those lovers.",未知
"And when the evening came, Mrs. Coulter might take Lyra to the theater, and again there would be lots of glamorous people to talk to and be admired by, for it seemed that Mrs. Coulter knew everyone important in London.",未知
In the intervals between all these other activities Mrs. Coulter would teach her the rudiments of geography and mathematics.,未知
"Lyra's knowledge had great gaps in it, like a map of the world largely eaten by mice, for at Jordan they had taught her in a piecemeal and disconnected way: a junior Scholar would be detailed to catch her and instruct her in such-and-such, and the lessons would continue for a sullen week or so until she ""forgot"" to turn up, to the Scholar's relief.",未知
"Or else a Scholar would forget what he was supposed to teach her, and drill her at great length about the subject of his current research, whatever that happened to be.",未知
It was no wonder her knowledge was patchy.,未知
"She knew about atoms and elementary particles, and anbaromagnetic charges and the four fundamental forces and other bits and pieces of experimental theology, but nothing about the solar system.",未知
"In fact, when Mrs. Coulter realized this and explained how the earth and the other five planets revolved around the sun, Lyra laughed loudly at the joke.",未知
"However, she was keen to show that she did know some things, and when Mrs. Coulter was telling her about electrons, she said expertly, ""Yes, they're negatively charged particles.",未知
"Sort of like Dust, except that Dust isn't charged.""",未知
"As soon as she said that, Mrs. Coulter's daemon snapped his head up to look at her, and all the golden fur on his little body stood up, bristling, as if it were charged itself.",未知
Mrs. Coulter laid a hand on his back.,未知
"""Dust?""",未知
she said.,未知
"""Yeah.",未知
"You know, from space, that Dust.""",未知
"""What do you know about Dust, Lyra?""",未知
"""Oh, that it comes out of space, and it lights people up, if you have a special sort of camera to see it by.",未知
Except not children.,未知
"It doesn't affect children.""",未知
"""Where did you learn that from?""",未知
"By now Lyra was aware that there was a powerful tension in the room, because Pantalaimon had crept ermine-like onto her lap and was trembling violently.",未知
"""Just someone in Jordan,"" Lyra said vaguely.",未知
"""I forget who.",未知
"I think it was one of the Scholars.""",未知
"""Was it in one of your lessons?""",未知
"""Yes, it might have been.",未知
Or else it might've been just in passing.,未知
Yes.,未知
I think that was it.,未知
"This Scholar, I think he was from New Denmark, he was talking to the Chaplain about Dust and I was just passing and it sounded interesting so I couldn't help stopping to listen.",未知
"That's what it was.""",未知
"""I see,"" said Mrs. Coulter.",未知
"""Is it right, what he told me?",未知
"Did I get it wrong?""",未知
"""Well, I don't know.",未知
I'm sure you know much more than I do.,未知
"Let's get back to those electrons....""
Later, Pantalaimon said, ""You know when all the fur stood up on her daemon?",未知
"Well, I was behind him, and she grabbed his fur so tight her knuckles went white.",未知
You couldn't see.,未知
It was a long time till his fur went down.,未知
"I thought he was going to leap at you.""",未知
"That was strange, no doubt; but neither of them knew what to make of it.",未知
"And finally, there were other kinds of lessons so gently and subtly given that they didn't feel like lessons at all.",未知
"How to wash one's own hair; how to judge which colors suited one; how to say no in such a charming way that no offense was given; how to put on lipstick, powder, scent.",未知
"To be sure, Mrs. Coulter didn't teach Lyra the latter arts directly, but she knew Lyra was watching when she made herself up, and she took care to let Lyra see where she kept the cosmetics, and to allow her time on her own to explore and try them out for herself.",未知
"*	*	*

Time passed, and autumn began to change into winter.",未知
"From time to time Lyra thought of Jordan College, but it seemed small and quiet compared to the busy life she led now.",未知
"Every so often she thought of Roger, too, and felt uneasy, but there was an opera to go to, or a new dress to wear, or the Royal Arctic Institute to visit, and then she forgot him again.",未知
"When Lyra had been living there for six weeks or so, Mrs. Coulter decided to hold a cocktail party.",未知
"Lyra had the impression that there was something to celebrate, though Mrs. Coulter never said what it was.",未知
"She ordered flowers, she discussed canapes and drinks with the caterer, and she spent a whole evening with Lyra deciding whom to invite.",主谓宾
"""We must have the archbishop.",未知
"I couldn't afford to leave him out, though he's the most hateful old snob.",未知
Lord Boreal is in town: he'll be fun.,未知
And the Princess Postnikova.,未知
Do you think it would be right to invite Erik Andersson?,一般疑问句
"I wonder if it's about time to take him up....""
Erik Andersson was the latest fashionable dancer.",未知
"Lyra had no idea what ""take him up"" meant, but she enjoyed giving her opinion nonetheless.",未知
"She dutifully wrote down all the names Mrs. Coulter suggested, spelling them atrociously and then crossing them out when Mrs. Coulter decided against them after all.",未知
"When Lyra went to bed, Pantalaimon whispered from the pillow:
""She's never going to the North!",未知
She's going to keep us here forever.,未知
"When are we going to run away?""",未知
"""She is,"" Lyra whispered back.",未知
"""You just don't like her.",未知
"Well, that's hard luck.",未知
I like her.,主谓宾
"And why would she be teaching us navigation and all that if she wasn't going to take us north?""",未知
"""To stop you getting impatient, that's why.",未知
You don't really want to stand around at the cocktail party being all sweet and pretty.,未知
"She's just making a pet out of you.""",未知
Lyra turned her back and closed her eyes.,主谓宾
But what Pantalaimon said was true.,未知
"She had been feeling confined and cramped by this polite life, however luxurious it was.",未知
"She would have given anything for a day with Roger and her Oxford ragamuffin friends, with a battle in the claybeds and a race along the canal.",未知
The one thing that kept her polite and attentive to Mrs. Coulter was that tantalizing hope of going north.,未知
Perhaps they would meet Lord Asriel.,未知
"Perhaps he and Mrs. Coulter would fall in love, and they would get married and adopt Lyra, and go and rescue Roger from the Gobblers.",未知
"On the afternoon of the cocktail party, Mrs. Coulter took Lyra to a fashionable hairdresser's, where her stiff dark blond hair was softened and waved, and her nails were filed and polished, and where they even applied a little makeup to her eyes and lips to show her how to do it.",未知
"Then they went to collect the new dress Mrs. Coulter had ordered for her, and to buy some patent-leather shoes, and then it was time to go back to the flat and check the flowers and get dressed.",未知
"""Not the shoulder bag, dear,"" said Mrs. Coulter as Lyra came out of her bedroom, glowing with a sense of her own prettiness.",未知
"Lyra had taken to wearing a little white leather shoulder bag everywhere, so as to keep the alethiometer close at hand.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter, loosening the cramped way some roses had been bunched into a vase, saw that Lyra wasn't moving and glanced pointedly at the door.",未知
"""Oh, please, Mrs. Coulter, I do love this bag!""",未知
"""Not indoors, Lyra.",未知
It looks absurd to be carrying a shoulder bag in your own home.,未知
"Take it off at once, and come and help check these glasses....""
It wasn't so much her snappish tone as the words ""in your own home"" that made Lyra resist stubbornly.",未知
"Pantalaimon flew to the floor and instantly became a polecat, arching his back against her little white ankle socks.",未知
"Encouraged by this, Lyra said:
""But it won't be in the way.",未知
And it's the only thing I really like wearing.,未知
"I think it really suits-""
She didn't finish the sentence, because Mrs. Coulter's daemon sprang off the sofa in a blur of golden fur and pinned Pantalaimon to the carpet before he could move.",主谓宾
"Lyra cried out in alarm, and then in fear and pain, as Pantalaimon twisted this way and that, shrieking and snarling, unable to loosen the golden monkey's grip.",未知
"Only a few seconds, and the monkey had overmastered him: with one fierce black paw around his throat and his black paws gripping the polecat's lower limbs, he took one of Pantalaimon's ears in his other paw and pulled as if he intended to tear it off.",未知
"Not angrily, either, but with a cold curious force that was horrifying to see and even worse to feel.",未知
Lyra sobbed in terror.,未知
"""Don't!",未知
Please!,未知
"Stop hurting us!""",未知
Mrs. Coulter looked up from her flowers.,未知
"""Do as I tell you, then,"" she said.",未知
"""I promise!""",未知
The golden monkey stepped away from Pantalaimon as if he were suddenly bored.,未知
"Pantalaimon fled to Lyra at once, and she scooped him up to her face to kiss and gentle.",未知
"""Now, Lyra,"" said Mrs. Coulter.",未知
"Lyra turned her back abruptly and slammed into her bedroom, but no sooner had she banged the door shut behind her than it opened again.",主谓宾
Mrs. Coulter was standing there only a foot or two away.,未知
"""Lyra, if you behave in this coarse and vulgar way, we shall have a confrontation, which I will win.",未知
Take off that bag this instant.,未知
Control that unpleasant frown.,未知
Never slam a door again in my hearing or out of it.,未知
"Now, the first guests will be arriving in a few minutes, and they are going to find you perfectly behaved, sweet, charming, innocent, attentive, delightful in every way.",未知
"I particularly wish for that, Lyra, do you understand me?""",未知
"""Yes, Mrs.",未知
"Coulter.""",未知
"""Then kiss me.""",未知
She bent a little and offered her cheek.,未知
Lyra had to stand on tiptoe to kiss it.,未知
"She noticed how smooth it was, and the slight perplexing smell of Mrs. Coulter's flesh: scented, but somehow metallic.",未知
She drew away and laid the shoulder bag on her dressing table before following Mrs. Coulter back to the drawing room.,未知
"""What do you think of the flowers, dear?""",未知
said Mrs. Coulter as sweetly as if nothing had happened.,未知
"""I suppose one can't go wrong with roses, but you can have too much of a good thing....Have the caterers brought enough ice?",未知
Be a dear and go and ask.,未知
"Warm drinks are horrid...""
Lyra found it was quite easy to pretend to be lighthearted and charming, though she was conscious every second of Pantalaimon's disgust, and of his hatred for the golden monkey.",未知
"Presently the doorbell rang, and soon the room was filling up with fashionably dressed ladies and handsome or distinguished men.",未知
Lyra moved among them offering canapes or smiling sweetly and making pretty answers when they spoke to her.,未知
"She felt like a universal pet, and the second she voiced that thought to herself, Pantalaimon stretched his goldfinch wings and chirruped loudly.",未知
"She sensed his glee at having proved her right, and became a little more retiring.",主谓宾
"""And where do you go to school, my dear?""",未知
"said an elderly lady, inspecting Lyra through a lorgnette.",未知
"""I don't go to school,"" Lyra told her.",未知
"""Really?",未知
I thought your mother would have sent you to her old school.,主谓宾
"A very good place...""
Lyra was mystified until she realized the old lady's mistake.",未知
"""Oh!",未知
She's not my mother!,未知
I'm just here helping her.,未知
"I'm her personal assistant,"" she said importantly.",主谓宾
"""I see.",未知
"And who are your people?""",未知
Again Lyra had to wonder what she meant before replying.,未知
"""They were a count and countess,"" she said.",未知
"""They both died in an aeronautical accident in the North.""",未知
"""Which count?""",未知
"""Count Belacqua.",未知
"He was Lord Asriel's brother.""",未知
"The old lady's daemon, a scarlet macaw, shifted as if in irritation from one foot to another.",未知
"The old lady was beginning to frown with curiosity, so Lyra smiled sweetly and moved on.",未知
She was going past a group of men and one young woman near the large sofa when she heard the word Dust.,未知
"She had seen enough of society now to understand when men and women were flirting, and she watched the process with fascination, though she was more fascinated by the mention of Dust, and she hung back to listen.",未知
"The men seemed to be Scholars; from the way the young woman was questioning them, Lyra took her to be a student of some kind.",未知
"""It was discovered by a Muscovite-stop me if you know this already-"" a middle-aged man was saying, as the young woman gazed at him in admiration, ""a man called Rusakov, and they're usually called Rusakov Particles after him.",未知
"Elementary particles that don't interact in any way with others-very hard to detect, but the extraordinary thing is that they seem to be attracted to human beings.""",未知
"""Really?""",未知
"said the young woman, wide-eyed.",未知
"""And even more extraordinary,"" he went on, ""some human beings more than others.",未知
"Adults attract it, but not children.",主谓宾
"At least, not much, and not until adolescence.",未知
"In fact, that's the very reason-"" His voice dropped, and he moved closer to the young woman, putting his hand confidentially on her shoulder.",未知
"""-that's the very reason the Oblation Board was set up.",未知
"As our good hostess here could tell you.""",未知
"""Really?",未知
"Is she involved with the Oblation Board?""",未知
"""My dear, she is the Oblation Board.",未知
"It's entirely her own project-""
The man was about to tell her more when he caught sight of Lyra.",未知
"She stared back at him unblinkingly, and perhaps he had had a little too much to drink, or perhaps he was keen to impress the young woman, for he said:
""This little lady knows all about it, I'll be bound.",未知
"You're safe from the Oblation Board, aren't you, my dear?""",未知
"""Oh, yes,"" said Lyra.",未知
"""I'm safe from everyone here.",未知
"Where I used to live, in Oxford, there was all kinds of dangerous things.",未知
There was gyptians-they take kids and sell 'em to the Turks for slaves.,there be句型
And on Port Meadow at the full moon there's a werewolf that comes out from the old nunnery at Godstow.,未知
I heard him howling once.,主谓宾
"And there's the Gobblers....""
""That's what I mean,"" the man said.",未知
"""That's what they call the Oblation Board, don't they?""",未知
"Lyra felt Pantalaimon tremble suddenly, but he was on his best behavior.",主谓宾
"The daemons of the two grownups, a cat and a butterfly, didn't seem to notice.",未知
"""Gobblers?""",未知
said the young woman.,未知
"""What a peculiar name!",未知
"Why do they call them Gobblers?""",未知
"Lyra was about to tell her one of the bloodcurdling stories she'd made up to frighten the Oxford kids with, but the man was already speaking.",未知
"""From the initials, d'you see?",未知
General Oblation Board.,未知
"Very old idea, as a matter of fact.",未知
"In the Middle Ages, parents would give their children to the church to be monks or nuns.",未知
And the unfortunate brats were known as oblates.,未知
"Means a sacrifice, an offering, something of that sort.",未知
So the same idea was taken up when they were looking into the Dust business....As our little friend probably knows.,未知
"Why don't you go and talk to Lord Boreal?""",未知
he added to Lyra directly.,未知
"""I'm sure he'd like to meet Mrs. Coulter's protegee....That's him, the man with gray hair and the serpent daemon.""",未知
He wanted to get rid of Lyra so that he could talk more privately with the young woman; Lyra could tell that easily.,未知
"But the young woman, it seemed, was still interested in Lyra, and slipped away from the man to talk to her.",未知
"""Stop a minute....What's your name?""",未知
"""Lyra.""",未知
"""I'm Adele Starminster.",未知
I'm a journalist.,未知
"Could I have a quiet word?""",未知
"Thinking it only natural that people should wish to talk to her, Lyra said simply, ""Yes.""",未知
"The woman's butterfly daemon rose into the air, casting about to left and right, and fluttered down to whisper something, at which Adele Starminster said, ""Come to the window seat.""",未知
"This was a favorite spot of Lyra's; it overlooked the river, and at this time of night, the lights across on the south bank were glittering brilliantly over their reflections in the black water of the high tide.",未知
A line of barges hauled by a tug moved upriver.,未知
Adele Starminster sat down and moved along the cushioned seat to make room.,未知
"""Did Professor Docker say that you had some connection with Mrs.",未知

"""Yes.""",未知
"""What is it?",未知
"You're not her daughter, by any chance?",未知

"""Ah, I see....And where do you come from?",未知
"What was your name again?""",未知
"""Lyra.",未知
"I come from Oxford.""",未知
"""Why did Mrs. Coulter pick you to-""
She stopped very suddenly, because Mrs. Coulter herself had appeared close by.",未知

"""I don't know your name,"" said Mrs. Coulter very quietly, ""but I shall find it out within five minutes, and then you will never work as a journalist again.",未知
"Now get up very quietly, without making a fuss, and leave.",未知
"I might add that whoever brought you here will also suffer.""",未知
Mrs. Coulter seemed to be charged with some kind of anbaric force.,未知
"She even smelled different: a hot smell, like heated metal, came off her body.",未知
"Lyra had felt something of it earlier, but now she was seeing it directed at someone else, and poor Adele Starminster had no force to resist.",未知
"Her daemon fell limp on her shoulder and flapped his gorgeous wings once or twice before fainting, and the woman herself seemed to be unable to stand fully upright.",未知
"Moving in a slight awkward crouch, she made her way through the press of loudly talking guests and out of the drawing room door.",未知

"""Just about what I was doing and who I was, and stuff like that.""",未知

How could that be?,特殊疑问句
"But a moment later the golden monkey appeared at her side, and, reaching down, she took his hand and swung him up lightly to her shoulder.",未知
At once she seemed at ease again.,未知
"""If you come across anyone else who obviously hasn't been invited, dear, do come and find me, won't you?""",未知
The hot metallic smell was vanishing.,未知
Perhaps Lyra had only imagined it.,未知
"She could smell Mrs. Coulter's scent again, and the roses, and the cigarillo smoke, and the scent of other women.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter smiled at Lyra in a way that seemed to say, ""You and I understand these things, don't we?""",未知
and moved on to greet some other guests.,未知
Pantalaimon was whispering in Lyra's ear.,未知

"She looked around to find him again, but no sooner had she seen him than the commissionaire (in servant's dress for the evening) and another man tapped the professor on the shoulder and spoke quietly to him, at which he turned pale and followed them out.",未知
"That took no more than a couple of seconds, and it was so discreetly done that hardly anyone noticed.",未知
But it left Lyra feeling anxious and exposed.,未知
"She wandered through the two big rooms where the party was taking place, half-listening to the conversations around her, half-interested in the taste of the cocktails she wasn't allowed to try, and increasingly fretful.",未知
"She wasn't aware that anyone was watching her until the commissionaire appeared at her side and bent to say:
""Miss Lyra, the gentleman by the fireplace would like to speak to you.",未知
"He's Lord Boreal, if you didn't know.""",未知
Lyra looked up across the room.,未知
"The powerful-looking gray-haired man was looking directly at her, and as their eyes met, he nodded and beckoned.",未知
"Unwilling, but more interested now, she went across.",未知

His voice was smooth and commanding.,未知
His serpent daemon's mailed head and emerald eyes glittered in the light from the cut-glass lamp on the wall nearby.,未知

"And if she's going to use you as well to bring them in, so much the better.",未知
"I'm very pleased.""",未知
He smiled at her in the way Mrs. Coulter had: as if they were both in on a secret.,未知
She smiled politely back and he turned away to talk to someone else.,未知
She and Pantalaimon could sense each other's horror.,未知
"She wanted to go away by herself and talk to him; she wanted to leave the flat; she wanted to go back to Jordan College and her little shabby bedroom on Staircase Twelve; she wanted to find Lord Asriel-
And as if in answer to that last wish, she heard his name mentioned, and wandered closer to the group talking nearby with the pretext of helping herself to a canape from the plate on the table.",未知

THE THROWING NETS




She walked quickly away from the river, because the embankment was wide and well lit.",未知
"There was a tangle of narrow streets between there and the Royal Arctic Institute, which was the only place Lyra was sure of being able to find, and into that dark maze she hurried now.",there be句型

Pantalaimon became a wildcat and scanned the dark all around with his night-piercing eyes.,未知
"Every so often he'd stop, bristling, and she would turn aside from the entrance she'd been about to go down.",未知
"The night was full of noises: bursts of drunken laughter, two raucous voices raised in song, the clatter and whine of some badly oiled machine in a basement.",未知
"Lyra walked delicately through it all, her senses magnified and mingled with Pantalaimon's, keeping to the shadows and the narrow alleys.",未知
"From time to time she had to cross a wider, well-lit street, where the tramcars hummed and sparked under their anbaric wires.",未知
"There were rules for crossing London streets, but she took no notice, and when anyone shouted, she fled.",there be句型
It was a fine thing to be free again.,未知
"She knew that Pantalaimon, padding on wildcat paws beside her, felt the same joy as she did to be in the open air, even if it was murky London air laden with fumes and soot and clangorous with noise.",未知
"Sometime soon they'd have to think over the meaning of what they'd heard in Mrs. Coulter's flat, but not yet.",未知
And sometime eventually they'd have to find a place to sleep.,未知
"At a crossroads near the corner of a big department store whose windows shone brilliantly over the wet pavement, there was a coffee stall: a little hut on wheels with a counter under the wooden flap that swung up like an awning.",未知
"Yellow light glowed inside, and the fragrance of coffee drifted out.",未知
The white-coated owner was leaning on the counter talking to the two or three customers.,未知
It was tempting.,未知

His daemon was a lemur.,未知
"It clung to his lapel, staring round-eyed at Lyra.",未知

"It was drizzling, but even if there'd been no clouds the city sky was too tainted with light to show the stars.",未知
"Pantalaimon thought they were going north, but who could tell?",未知
"Endless streets of little identical brick houses, with gardens only big enough for a dustbin; great gaunt factories behind wire fences, with one anbaric light glowing bleakly high up on a wall and a night watchman snoozing by his brazier; occasionally a dismal oratory, only distinguished from a warehouse by the crucifix outside.",未知
"Once she tried the door of one of these places, only to hear a groan from the bench a foot away in the darkness.",未知

"A dim light shone in one window of a wooden hut, and a thread of smoke rose from the metal chimney; otherwise the only lights were high up on the wall of the warehouse or the gantry of a crane, leaving the ground in gloom.",未知
"The wharves were piled with barrels of coal spirit, with stacks of great round logs, with rolls of cauchuc-covered cable.",未知
Lyra tiptoed up to the hut and peeped in at the window.,未知
"An old man was laboriously reading a picture'Story paper and smoking a pipe, with his spaniel daemon curled up asleep on the table.",未知
"As she looked, the man got up and brought a blackened kettle from the iron stove and poured some hot water into a cracked mug before settling back with his paper.",未知
"""Should we ask him to let us in, Pan?""",未知
"she whispered, but he was distracted; he was a bat, an owl, a wildcat again; she looked all round, catching his panic, and then saw them at the same time as he did: two men running at her, one from each side, the nearer holding a throwing net.",未知
"Pantalaimon uttered a harsh scream and launched himself as a leopard at the closer man's daemon, a savage-looking fox, bowling her backward and tangling with the man's legs.",未知
"The man cursed and dodged aside, and Lyra darted past him toward the open spaces of the wharf.",未知
What she mustn't do was get boxed in a corner.,未知
"Pantalaimon, an eagle now, swooped at her and cried, ""Left!",未知
"Left!""",未知
"She swerved that way and saw a gap between the coal-spirit barrels and the end of a corrugated iron shed, and darted for it like a bullet.",未知
But those throwing nets!,未知
"She heard a hiss in the air, and past her cheek something lashed and sharply stung, and loathsome tarred strings whipped across her face, her arms, her hands, and tangled and held her, and she fell, snarling and tearing and struggling in vain.",未知
"""Pan!",未知
"Pan!""",未知
"But the fox daemon tore at the cat Pantalaimon, and Lyra felt the pain in her own flesh, and sobbed a great cry as he fell.",未知
"One man was swiftly lashing cords around her, around her limbs, her throat, body, head, bundling her over and over on the wet ground.",未知
"She was helpless, exactly like a fly being trussed by a spider.",未知
"Poor hurt Pan was dragging himself toward her, with the fox daemon worrying his back, and he had no strength left to change, even; and the other man was lying in a puddle, with an arrow through his neck-
The whole world grew still as the man tying the net saw it too.",主谓宾
"Pantalaimon sat up and blinked, and then there was a soft thud, and the net man fell choking and gasping right across Lyra, who cried out in horror: that was blood gushing out of him!",未知
"Running feet, and someone hauled the man away and bent over him; then other hands lifted Lyra, a knife snicked and pulled and the net strings fell away one by one, and she tore them off, spitting, and hurled herself down to cuddle Pantalaimon.",未知
"Kneeling, she twisted to look up at the newcomers.",未知
"Three dark men, one armed with a bow, the others with knives; and as she turned, the bowman caught his breath.",未知
"""That en't Lyra?""",未知
"A familiar voice, but she couldn't place it till he stepped forward and the nearest light fell on his face and the hawk daemon on his shoulder.",未知
Then she had it.,未知
A gyptian!,未知
A real Oxford gyptian!,未知
"""Tony Costa,"" he said.",未知
"""Remember?",未知
"You used to play with my little brother Billy off the boats in Jericho, afore the Gobblers got him.""",未知
"""Oh, God, Pan, we're safe!""",未知
"she sobbed, but then a thought rushed into her mind: it was the Costas' boat she'd hijacked that day.",未知
Suppose he remembered?,未知
"""Better come along with us,"" he said.",未知
"""You alone?""",未知
"""Yeah.",未知
"I was running away....""
""All right, don't talk now.",未知
Just keep quiet.,未知
"Jaxer, move them bodies into the shadow.",未知
"Kerim, look around.""",未知
"Lyra stood up shakily, holding the wildcat Pantalaimon to her breast.",未知
"He was twisting to look at something, and she followed his gaze, understanding and suddenly curious too: what had happened to the dead men's daemons?",未知
"They were fading, that was the answer; fading and drifting away like atoms of smoke, for all that they tried to cling to their men.",未知
"Pantalaimon hid his eyes, and Lyra hurried blindly after Tony Costa.",主谓宾
"""What are you doing here?""",未知
she said.,未知
"""Quiet, gal.",未知
There's enough trouble awake without stirring more.,未知
"We'll talk on the boat.""",未知
He led her over a little wooden bridge into the heart of the canal basin.,主谓宾
The other two men were padding silently after them.,未知
"Tony turned along the waterfront and out onto a wooden jetty, from which he stepped on board a narrowboat and swung open the door to the cabin.",未知
"""Get in,"" he said.",未知
"""Quick now.""",未知
"Lyra did so, patting her bag (which she had never let go of, even in the net) to make sure the alethiometer was still there.",未知
"In the long narrow cabin, by the light of a lantern on a hook, she saw a stout powerful woman with gray hair, sitting at a table with a paper.",未知
Lyra recognized her as Billy's mother.,主谓宾
"""Who's this?""",未知
the woman said.,未知
"""That's never Lyra?""",未知
"""That's right.",未知
"Ma, we got to move.",未知
We killed two men out in the basin.,未知
"We thought they was Gobblers, but I reckon they were Turk traders.",主谓宾
They'd caught Lyra.,未知
"Never mind talk-we'll do that on the move.""",未知
"""Come here, child,"" said Ma Costa.",未知
"Lyra obeyed, half happy, half apprehensive, for Ma Costa had hands like bludgeons, and now she was sure: it was their boat she had captured with Roger and the other collegers.",未知
"But the boat mother set her hands on either side of Lyra's face, and her daemon, a hawk, bent gently to lick Pantalaimon's wildcat head.",未知
Then Ma Costa folded her great arms around Lyra and pressed her to her breast.,未知
"""I dunno what you're a doing here, but you look wore out.",未知
"You can have Billy's crib, soon's I've got a hot drink in you.",未知
"Set you down there, child.""",未知
"It looked as if her piracy was forgiven, or at least forgotten.",未知
Lyra slid onto the cushioned bench behind a well-scrubbed pine table top as the low rumble of the gas engine shook the boat.,未知
"""Where we going?""",未知
Lyra asked.,未知
Ma Costa was setting a saucepan of milk on the iron stove and riddling the grate to stir the fire up.,未知
"""Away from here.",未知
No talking now.,未知
"We'll talk in the morning.""",未知
"And she said no more, handing Lyra a cup of milk when it was ready, swinging herself up on deck when the boat began to move, exchanging occasional whispers with the men.",未知
Lyra sipped the milk and lifted a corner of the blind to watch the dark wharves move past.,未知
A minute or two later she was sound asleep.,未知
"She awoke in a narrow bed, with that comforting engine rumble deep below.",未知
"She sat up, banged her head, cursed, felt around, and got up more carefully.",未知
"A thin gray light showed her three other bunks, each empty and neatly made, one below hers and the other two across the tiny cabin.",未知
"She swung over the side to find herself in her underclothes, and saw the dress and the wolfskin coat folded at the end of her bunk together with her shopping bag.",未知
The alethiometer was still there.,未知
"She dressed quickly and went through the door at the end to find herself in the cabin with the stove, where it was warm.",未知
There was no one there.,there be句型
"Through the windows she saw a gray swirl of fog on each side, with occasional dark shapes that might have been buildings or trees.",未知
"Before she could go out on deck, the outer door opened and Ma Costa came down, swathed in an old tweed coat on which the damp had settled like a thousand tiny pearls.",未知
"""Sleep well?""",未知
"she said, reaching for a frying pan.",未知
"""Now sit down out the way and I'll make ye some breakfast.",未知
"Don't stand about; there en't room.""",未知
"""Where are we?""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""On the Grand Junction Canal.",未知
"You keep out of sight, child.",未知
I don't want to see you topside.,未知
"There's trouble.""",未知
"She sliced a couple of rashers of bacon into the frying pan, and cracked an egg to go with them.",未知
"""What sort of trouble?""",未知
"""Nothing we can't cope with, if you stay out the way.""",未知
And she wouldn't say any more till Lyra had eaten.,未知
"The boat slowed at one point, and something banged against the side, and she heard men's voices raised in anger; but then someone's joke made them laugh, and the voices drew away and the boat moved on.",未知
Presently Tony Costa swung down into the cabin.,未知
"Like his mother, he was pearled with damp, and he shook his woollen hat over the stove to make the drops jump and spit.",未知
"""What we going to tell her, Ma?""",未知
"""Ask first, tell after.""",未知
He poured some coffee into a tin cup and sat down.,未知
"He was a powerful, dark-faced man, and now that she could see him in daylight, Lyra saw a sad grimness in his expression.",未知
"""Right,"" he said.",未知
"""Now you tell us what you was doing in London, Lyra.",未知
"We had you down as being took by the Gobblers.""",未知
"""I was living with this lady, right...""
Lyra clumsily collected her story and shook it into order as if she were settling a pack of cards ready for dealing.",未知
"She told them everything, except about the alethiometer.",主谓宾
"""And then last night at this cocktail party I found out what they were really doing.",未知
"Mrs. Coulter was one of the Gobblers herself, and she was going to use me to help her catch more kids.",未知
"And what they do is-""
Ma Costa left the cabin and went out to the cockpit.",未知
"Tony waited till the door was shut, and cut in:
""We know what they do.",未知
"Least, we know part of it.",未知
We know they don't come back.,主谓宾
"Them kids is taken up north, far out the way, and they do experiments on 'em.",未知
"At first we reckoned they tried out different diseases and medicines, but there'd be no reason to start that all of a sudden two or three years back.",未知
"Then we thought about the Tartars, maybe there's some secret deal they're making up Siberia way; because the Tartars want to move north just as much as the rest, for the coal spirit and the fire mines, and there's been rumors of war for even longer than the Gobblers been going.",未知
"And we reckoned the Gobblers were buying off the Tartar chiefs by giving 'em kids, cause the Tartars eat 'em, don't they?",未知
"They bake children and eat ""em.""",未知
"""They never!""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""They do.",未知
"There's plenty of other things to be told, and all.",未知
"You ever heard of the Nalkainens?""",未知
"Lyra said, ""No.",未知
Not even with Mrs. Coulter.,未知
"What are they?""",未知
"""That's a kind of ghost they have up there in those forests.",未知
"Same size as a child, and they got no heads.",未知
They feel their way about at night and if you're a sleeping out in the forest they get ahold of you and won't nothing make 'em let go.,主谓宾
"Nalkainens, that's a northern word.",未知
"And the Windsuckers, they're dangerous too.",未知
They drift about in the air.,未知
"You come across clumps of 'em floated together sometimes, or caught snagged on a bramble.",未知
"As soon as they touch you, all the strength goes out of you.",未知
You can't see 'em except as a kind of shimmer in the air.,未知
"And the Breathless Ones...""
""Who are they?""",未知
"""Warriors half-killed.",未知
"Being alive is one thing, and being dead's another, but being half-killed is worse than either.",未知
"They just can't die, and living is altogether beyond 'em.",未知
They wander about forever.,未知
"They're called the Breathless Ones because of what's been done to 'em.""",未知
"""And what's that?""",未知
"said Lyra, wide-eyed.",未知
"""The North Tartars snap open their ribs and pull out their lungs.",未知
There's an art to it.,未知
"They do it without killing 'em, but their lungs can't work anymore without their daemons pumping 'em by hand, so the result is they're halfway between breath and no breath, life and death, half-killed, you see.",主谓宾
"And their daemons got to pump and pump all day and night, or else perish with 'em.",未知
"You come across a whole platoon of Breathless Ones in the forest sometimes, I've heard.",未知
And then there's the panserbj0rne-you heard of them?,未知
That means armored bears.,未知
"They're great white bears, and-""
""Yes!",未知
I have heard of them!,未知
"One of the men last night, he said that my uncle, Lord Asriel, he's being imprisoned in a fortress guarded by the armored bears.""",未知
"""Is he, now?",未知
"And what was he doing up there?""",未知
"""Exploring.",未知
But the way the man was talking I don't think my uncle's on the same side as the Gobblers.,未知
"I think they were glad he was in prison.""",未知
"""Well, he won't get out if the armored bears are guarding him.",未知
"They're like mercenaries, you know what I mean by that?",未知
They sell their strength to whoever pays.,主谓宾
"They got hands like men, and they learned the trick of working iron way back, meteoric iron mostly, and they make great sheets and plates of it to cover theirselves with.",主谓宾
They been raiding the Skraelings for centuries.,未知
"They're vicious killers, absolutely pitiless.",未知
But they keep their word.,未知
"If you make a bargain with a panserbj0m, you can rely on it.""",未知
Lyra considered these horrors with awe.,未知
"""Ma don't like to hear about the North,"" Tony said after a few moments, ""because of what might've happened to Billy.",未知
"We know they took him up north, see.""",未知
"""How d'you know that?""",未知
"""We caught one of the Gobblers, and made him talk.",未知
That's how we know a little about what they're doing.,未知
Them two last night weren't Gobblers; they were too clumsy.,未知
If they'd been Gobblers we'd've took 'em alive.,未知
"See, the gyptian people, we been hit worse than most by these Gobblers, and we're a coming together to decide what to do about it.",未知
"That's what we was doing in the basin last night, taking on stores, 'cause we're going to a big muster up in the fens, what we call a roping.",未知
"And what I reckon is we're a going to send out a rescue party, when we heard what all the other gyptians know, when we put our knowledge together.",未知

JOHN FAA




Now that Lyra had a task in mind, she felt much better.",未知
"Helping Mrs. Coulter had been all very well, but Pantalaimon was right: she wasn't really doing any work there, she was just a pretty pet.",未知
"On the gyptian boat, there was real work to do, and Ma Costa made sure she did it.",未知
"She cleaned and swept, she peeled potatoes and made tea, she greased the propeller shaft bearings, she kept the weed trap clear over the propeller, she washed dishes, she opened lock gates, she tied the boat up at mooring posts, and within a couple of days she was as much at home with this new life as if she'd been born gyptian.",未知
What she didn't notice was that the Costas were alert every second for unusual signs of interest in Lyra from the waterside people.,未知
"If she hadn't realized it, she was important, and Mrs. Coulter and the Oblation Board were bound to be searching everywhere for her.",未知
"Indeed, Tony heard from gos-sip in pubs along the way that the police were making raids on houses and farms and building yards and factories without any explanation, though there was a rumor that they were searching for a missing girl.",未知
"And that in itself was odd, considering all the kids that had gone missing without being looked for.",未知
Gyptians and land folk alike were getting jumpy and nervous.,未知
And there was another reason for the Costas' interest in Lyra; but she wasn't to learn that for a few days yet.,未知
"So they took to keeping her below decks when they passed a lockkeeper's cottage or a canal basin, or anywhere there were likely to be idlers hanging about.",未知
"Once they passed through a town where the police were searching all the boats that came along the waterway, and holding up the traffic in both directions.",未知
"The Costas were equal to that, though.",未知
"There was a secret compartment beneath Ma's bunk, where Lyra lay cramped for two hours while the police banged up and down the length of the boat unsuccessfully.",there be句型
"""Why didn't their daemons find me, though?""",未知
"she asked afterward, and Ma showed her the lining of the secret space: cedarwood, which had a soporific effect on daemons; and it was true that Pantalaimon had spent the whole time happily asleep by Lyra's head.",未知
"Slowly, with many halts and detours, the Costas' boat drew nearer the fens, that wide and never fully mapped wilderness of huge skies and endless marshland in Eastern Anglia.",未知
"The furthest fringe of it mingled indistinguishably with the creeks and tidal inlets of the shallow sea, and the other side of the sea mingled indistinguishably with Holland; and parts of the fens had been drained and dyked by Hollanders, some of whom had settled there; so the language of the fens was thick with Dutch.",未知
"But parts had never been drained or planted or settled at all, and in the wildest central regions, where eels slithered and waterbirds flocked, where eerie marsh fires flick-ered and waylurkers tempted careless travelers to their doom in the swamps and bogs, the gyptian people had always found it safe to muster.",未知
"And now by a thousand winding channels and creeks and watercourses, gyptian boats were moving in toward the byanplats, the only patch of slightly higher ground in the hundreds of square miles of marsh and bog.",未知
"There was an ancient wooden meeting hall there with a huddle of permanent dwellings around it, and wharves and jetties and an eelmarket.",there be句型
When the gyptians called a byanroping-a summons or muster of families-so many boats filled the waterways that you could walk for a mile in any direction over their decks; or so it was said.,未知
The gyptians ruled in the fens.,未知
"No one else dared enter, and while the gyptians kept the peace and traded fairly, the landlopers turned a blind eye to the incessant smuggling and the occasional feuds.",未知
"If a gyptian body floated ashore down the coast, or got snagged in a fishnet, well-it was only a gyptian.",未知
"Lyra listened enthralled to tales of the fen dwellers, of the great ghost dog Black Shuck, of the marsh fires arising from bubbles of witch oil, and began to think of herself as gyptian even before they reached the fens.",未知
"She had soon slipped back into her Oxford voice, and now she was acquiring a gyptian one, complete with Fen-Dutch words.",未知
Ma Costa had to remind her of a few things.,未知
"""You en't gyptian, Lyra.",未知
"You might pass for gyptian with practice, but there's more to us than gyptian language.",未知
There's deeps in us and strong currents.,未知
"We're water people all through, and you en't, you're a fire person.",主谓宾
"What you're most like is marsh fire, that's the place you have in the gyptian scheme; you got witch oil in your soul.",未知
"Deceptive, that's what you are, child.""",未知
Lyra was hurt.,未知
"""I en't never deceived anyone!",未知
"You ask..."" There was no one to ask, of course, and Ma Costa laughed, but kindly.",未知
"""Can't you see I'm a paying you a compliment, you gosling?""",未知
"she said, and Lyra was pacified, though she didn't understand.",未知
"When they reached the byanplats it was evening, and the sun was about to set in a splash of bloody sky.",未知
"The low island and the Zaal were humped blackly against the light, like the clustered buildings around; threads of smoke rose into the still air, and from the press of boats all around came the smells of frying fish, of smokeleaf, of jenniver spirit.",未知
"They tied up close to the Zaal itself, at a mooring Tony said had been used by their family for generations.",未知
"Presently Ma Costa had the frying pan going, with a couple of fat eels hissing and sputtering and the kettle on for potato powder.",未知
"Tony and Kerim oiled their hair, put on their finest leather jackets and blue spotted neckerchiefs, loaded their fingers with silver rings, and went to greet some old friends in the neighboring boats and drink a glass or two in the nearest bar.",未知
They came back with important news.,未知
"""We got here just in time.",未知
The Roping's this very night.,未知
"And they're a saying in the town-what d'you think of this?- they're saying that the missing child's on a gyptian boat, and she's a going to appear tonight at the Roping!""",未知
He laughed loudly and ruffled Lyra's hair.,未知
"Ever since they'd entered the fens he had been more and more good tempered, as if the savage gloom his face showed outside were only a disguise.",未知
"And Lyra felt an excitement growing in her breast as she ate quickly and washed the dishes before combing her hair, tucking the alethiometer into the wolfskin coat pocket, and jumping ashore with all the other families making their way up the slope to the Zaal.",未知
She had thought Tony was joking.,未知
"She soon found that he wasn't, or else that she looked less like a gyptian than she'd thought, for many people stared, and children pointed, and by the time they reached the great doors of the Zaal they were walking alone between a crowd on either side, who had fallen back to stare and give them room.",未知
And then Lyra began to feel truly nervous.,未知
"She kept close to Ma Costa, and Pantalaimon became as big as he could and took his panther shape to reassure her.",未知
"Ma Costa trudged up the steps as if nothing in the world could possibly either stop her or make her go more quickly, and Tony and Kerim walked proudly on either side like princes.",未知
"The hall was lit by naphtha lamps, which shone brightly enough on the faces and bodies of the audience, but left the lofty rafters hidden in darkness.",未知
"The people coming in had to struggle to find room on the floor, where the benches were already crowded; but families squeezed up to make space, children occupying laps and daemons curling up underfoot or perching out of the way on the rough wooden walls.",未知
At the front of the Zaal there was a platform with eight carved wooden chairs set out.,未知
"As Lyra and the Costas found space to stand along the edge of the hall, eight men appeared from the shadows at the rear of the platform and stood in front of the chairs.",未知
A ripple of excitement swept over the audience as they hushed one another and shoved themselves into spaces on the nearest bench.,未知
Finally there was silence and seven of the men on the platform sat down.,未知
"The one who remained was in his seventies, but tall and bull necked and powerful.",未知
"He wore a plain canvas jacket and a checked shirt, like many gyptian men; there was nothing to mark him out but the air of strength and authority he had.",未知
"Lyra recognized it: Uncle Asriel had it, and so did the Master of Jordan.",主谓宾
"This man's daemon was a crow, very like the Master's raven.",未知
"""That's John Faa, the lord of the western gyptians,"" Tony whispered.",未知
"John Faa began to speak, in a deep slow voice.",未知
"""Gyptians!",未知
Welcome to the Roping.,未知
We've come to listen and come to decide.,未知
You all know why.,未知
There are many families here who've lost a child.,there be句型

Someone is taking them.,未知
"To be sure, landlopers are losing children too.",未知
We have no quarrel with landlopers over this.,未知
"""Now there's been talk about a child and a reward.",未知
Here's the truth to stop all gossip.,未知
"The child's name is Lyra Belacqua, and she's being sought by the landloper police.",未知
There is a reward of one thousand sovereigns for giving her up to them.,there be句型
"She's a landloper child, and she's in our care, and there she's going to stay.",未知
Anyone tempted by those thousand sovereigns had better find a place neither on land nor on water.,未知
"We en't giving her up.""",未知
Lyra felt a blush from the roots of her hair to the soles of her feet; Pantalaimon became a brown moth to hide.,未知
"Eyes all around were turning to them, and she could only look up at Ma Costa for reassurance.",未知
"But John Faa was speaking again:
""Talk all we may, we won't change owt.",未知
We must act if we want to change things.,未知
"Here's another fact for you: the Gobblers, these child thieves, are a taking their prisoners to a town in the far North, way up in the land of dark.",未知
I don't know what they do with 'em there.,未知
"Some folk say they kill 'em, other folk say different.",未知
We don't know.,未知
"""What we do know is that they do it with the help of the landloper police and the clergy.",未知

Remember that.,未知
They know what's going on and they'll help it whenever they can.,未知
"""So what I'm proposing en't easy.",未知
And I need your agreement.,未知
I'm proposing that we send a band of fighters up north to rescue them kids and bring 'em back alive.,未知
"I'm proposing that we put our gold into this, and all the craft and courage we can muster.",未知
"Yes, Raymond van Gerrit?""",未知
"A man in the audience had raised his hand, and John Faa sat down to let him speak.",未知
"""Beg pardon, Lord Faa.",未知
There's landloper kids as well as gyptians been taken captive.,未知
"Are you saying we should rescue them as well?""",未知
John Faa stood up to answer.,未知
"""Raymond, are you saying we should fight our way through every kind of danger to a little group of frightened children, and then say to some of them that they can come home, and to the rest that they have to stay?",未知
"No, you're a better man than that.",未知
"Well, do I have your approval, my friends?""",未知
"The question caught them by surprise, for there was a moment's hesitation; but then a full-throated roar filled the hall, and hands were clapped in the air, fists shaken, voices raised in excited clamor.",未知
"The rafters of the Zaal shook, and from their perches up in the dark a score of sleeping birds woke up in fear and flapped their wings, and little showers of dust drifted down.",未知
"John Faa let the noise continue for a minute, and then raised his hand for silence again.",未知
"""This'll take a while to organize.",未知
I want the heads of the families to raise a tax and muster a levy.,未知
We'll meet again here in three days' time.,未知
"In between now and then I'm a going to talk with the child I mentioned before, and with Farder Coram, and form a plan to put before you when we meet.",未知
"Goodnight to ye all.""",未知
"His massive, plain, blunt presence was enough to calm them.",未知
"As the audience began to move out of the great doors into the chilly evening, to go to their boats or to the crowded bars of the little settlement, Lyra said to Ma Costa:
""Who are the other men on the platform?""",未知
"""The heads of the six families, and the other man is Farder Coram.""",未知
"It was easy to see who she meant by the other man, because he was the oldest one there.",未知
"He walked with a stick, and all the time he'd been sitting behind John Faa he'd been trembling as if with an ague.",未知
"""Come on,"" said Tony.",未知
"""I'd best take you up to pay your respects to John Faa.",未知
You call him Lord Faa.,主谓宾
"I don't know what you'll be asked, but mind you tell the truth.""",未知
"Pantalaimon was a sparrow now, and sat curiously on Lyra's shoulder, his claws deep in the wolfskin coat, as she followed Tony through the crowd up to the platform.",未知
He lifted her up.,主谓宾
"Knowing that everyone still in the hall was staring at her, and conscious of those thousand sovereigns she was suddenly worth, she blushed and hesitated.",未知
"Pantalaimon darted to her breast and became a wildcat, sitting up in her arms and hissing softly as he looked around.",未知
"Lyra felt a push, and stepped forward to John Faa.",未知
"He was stern and massive and expressionless, more like a pillar of rock than a man, but he stooped and held out his hand to shake.",未知
"When she put hers in, it nearly vanished.",未知
"""Welcome, Lyra,"" he said.",未知
"Close to, she felt his voice rumbling like the earth itself.",未知
"She would have been nervous but for Pantalaimon, and the fact that John Faa's stony expression had warmed a little.",未知
He was treating her very gently.,未知
"""Thank you, Lord Faa,"" she said.",未知
"""Now you come in the parley room and we'll have a talk,"" said John Faa.",未知
"""Have they been feeding you proper, the Costas?""",未知
"""Oh, yes.",未知
"We had eels for supper.""",未知
"""Proper fen eels, I expect.""",未知
"The parley room was a comfortable place with a big fire, sideboards laden with silver and porcelain, and a heavy table darkly polished by the years, at which twelve chairs were drawn up.",未知
"The other men from the platform had gone elsewhere, but the old shaking man was still with them.",未知
John Faa helped him to a seat at the table.,未知
"""Now, you sit here on my right,"" John Faa said to Lyra, and took the chair at the head of the table himself.",未知
Lyra found herself opposite Farder Coram.,主谓宾
She was a little frightened by his skull-like face and his continual trembling.,未知
"His daemon was a beautiful autumn-colored cat, massive in size, who stalked along the table with upraised tail and elegantly inspected Pantalaimon, touching noses briefly before settling on Farder Coram's lap, half-closing her eyes and purring softly.",未知
"A woman whom Lyra hadn't noticed came out of the shadows with a tray of glasses, set it down by John Faa, curtsied, and left.",未知
"John Faa poured little glasses of jenniver from a stone crock for himself and Farder Coram, and wine for Lyra.",未知
"""So,"" John Faa said.",未知
"""You run away, Lyra.""",未知
"""Yes.""",未知
"""And who was the lady you run away from?""",未知
"""She was called Mrs. Coulter.",未知
"And I thought she was nice, but I found out she was one of the Gobblers.",未知
"I heard someone say what the Gobblers were, they were called the General Oblation Board, and she was in charge of it, it was all her idea.",主谓宾
"And they was all working on some plan, I dunno what it was, only they was going to make me help her get kids for 'em.",未知
"But they never knew...""
""They never knew what?""",未知
"""Well, first they never knew that I knew some kids what had been took.",未知
"My friend Roger the kitchen boy from Jordan College, and Billy Costa, and a girl out the covered market in Oxford.",未知
"And another thing...My uncle, right, Lord Asriel.",未知
"1 heard them talking about his journeys to the North, and I don't reckon he's got anything to do with the Gobblers.",未知
"Because I spied on the Master and the Scholars of Jordan, right, I hid in the Retiring Room where no one's supposed to go except them, and I heard him tell them all about his expedition up north, and the Dust he saw, and he brought back the head of Stanislaus Grumman, what the Tartars had made a hole in.",未知
And now the Gobblers've got him locked up somewhere.,未知
The armored bears are guarding him.,未知
"And I want to rescue him.""",未知
"She looked fierce and stubborn as she sat there, small against the high carved back of the chair.",未知
"The two old men couldn't help smiling, but whereas Farder Coram's smile was a hesitant, rich, complicated expression that trembled across his face like sunlight chasing shadows on a windy March day, John Faa's smile was slow, warm, plain, and kindly.",未知
"""You better tell us what you did hear your uncle say that evening,"" said John Faa.",未知
"""Don't leave anything out, mind.",未知
"Tell us everything.""",未知
"Lyra did, more slowly than she'd told the Costas but more honestly, too.",未知
"She was afraid of John Faa, and what she was most afraid of was his kindness.",未知
"When she'd finished, Farder Coram spoke for the first time.",未知
"His voice was rich and musical, with as many tones in it as there were colors in his daemon's fur.",未知
"""This Dust,"" he said.",未知
"""Did they ever call it anything else, Lyra?""",未知
"""No.",未知
Just Dust.,未知
"Mrs. Coulter told me what it was, elementary particles, but that's all she called it.""",未知
"""And they think that by doing something to children, they can find out more about it?""",未知
"""Yes.",未知
But I don't know what.,未知
Except my uncle...There's something I forgot to tell you.,未知
"When he was showing them lantern slides, there was another one he had.",未知
"It was the Roarer-""
""The what?""",未知
said John Faa.,未知
"""The Aurora,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""Is that right, Lyra?""",未知
"""Yeah, that's it.",未知
And in the lights of the Roarer there was like a city.,未知
All towers and churches and domes and that.,未知
"It was a bit like Oxford, that's what I thought, anyway.",未知
"And Uncle Asriel, he was more interested in that, I think, but the Master and the other Scholars were more interested in Dust, like Mrs. Coulter and Lord Boreal and them.""",未知
"""I see,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""That's very interesting.""",未知
"""Now, Lyra,"" said John Faa, ""I'm a going to tell you something.",未知
"Farder Coram here, he's a wise man.",未知
He's a seer.,未知
"He's been a follering all what's been going on with Dust and the Gobblers and Lord Asriel and everything else, and he's been a follering you.",未知
"Every time the Costas went to Oxford, or half a dozen other families, come to that, they brought back a bit of news.",未知
"About you, child.",未知
"Did you know that?""",未知
Lyra shook her head.,主谓宾
She was beginning to be frightened.,未知
"Pantalaimon was growling too deep for anyone to hear, but she could feel it in her fingertips down inside his fur.",未知
"""Oh, yes,"" said John Faa, ""all your doings, they all get back to Farder Coram here.""",未知
Lyra couldn't hold it in.,未知
"""We didn't damage it!",未知
Honest!,未知
It was only a bit of mud!,未知
"And we never got very far-""
""What are you talking about, child?""",未知
said John Faa.,未知
Farder Coram laughed.,未知
"When he did that, his shaking stopped and his face became bright and young.",未知
But Lyra wasn't laughing.,未知
"With trembling lips she said, ""And even if we had found the bung, we'd never've took it out!",未知
It was just a joke.,未知
"We wouldn't've sunk it, never!""",未知
Then John Faa began to laugh too.,未知
"He slapped a broad hand on the table so hard the glasses rang, and his massive shoulders shook, and he had to wipe away the tears from his eyes.",未知
"Lyra had never seen such a sight, never heard such a bellow; it was like a mountain laughing.",未知
"""Oh, yes,"" he said when he could speak again, ""we heard about that too, little girl!",未知
I don't suppose the Costas have set foot anywhere since then without being reminded of it.,未知
"You better leave a guard on your boat, Tony, people say.",未知
Fierce little girls round here!,未知
"Oh, that story went all over the fens, child.",未知
But we en't going to punish you for it.,未知
"No, no!",未知
"Ease your mind.""",未知
"He looked at Farder Coram, and the two old men laughed again, but more gently.",未知
"And Lyra felt contented, and safe.",未知
Finally John Faa shook his head and became serious again.,未知
"""I were saying, Lyra, as we knew about you from a child.",未知
From a baby.,未知
You oughter know what we know.,未知
"I can't guess what they told you at Jordan College about where you came from, but they don't know the whole truth of it.",未知
"Did they ever tell you who your parents were?""",未知
Now Lyra was completely dazed.,未知
"""Yes,"" she said.",未知
"""They said I was-they said they-they said Lord Asriel put me there because my mother and father died in an airship accident.",未知
"That's what they told me.""",未知
"""Ah, did they.",未知
"Well now, child, I'm a going to tell you a story, a true story.",未知
"I know it's true, because a gyptian woman told me, and they all tell the truth to John Faa and Farder Coram.",主谓宾
"So this is the truth about yourself, Lyra.",未知
"Your father never perished in no airship accident, because your father is Lord Asriel.""",未知
Lyra could only sit in wonder.,未知
"""Here's how it came about,"" John Faa went on.",未知
"""When he was a young man, Lord Asriel went exploring all over the North, and came back with a great fortune.",未知
"And he was a high-spirited man, quick to anger, a passionate man.",未知
"""And your mother, she was passionate too.",未知
"Not so well born as him, but a clever woman.",未知
"A Scholar, even, and those who saw her said she was very beautiful.",未知
"She and your father, they fell in love as soon's they met.",未知
"""The trouble was, your mother was already married.",未知
She'd married a politician.,未知
"He was a member of the king's party, one of his closest advisers.",未知
A rising man.,未知
"""Now when your mother found herself with child, she feared to tell her husband the child wasn't his.",未知
"And when the baby was born-that's you, girl-it was clear from the look of you that you didn't favor her husband, but your true father, and she thought it best to hide you away and give out that you'd died.",未知
"""So you was took to Oxfordshire, where your father had estates, and put in the care of a gyptian woman to nurse.",未知
"But someone whispered to your mother's husband what had happened, and he came a flying down and ransacked the cottage where the gyptian woman had been, only she'd fled to the great house; and the husband followed after, in a murderous passion.",未知
"""Lord Asriel was out a hunting, but they got word to him and he came riding back in time to find your mother's husband at the foot of the great staircase.",未知
"Another moment and he'd have forced open the closet where the gyptian woman was hiding with you, but Lord Asriel challenged him, and they fought there and then, and Lord Asriel killed him.",未知
"""The gyptian woman heard and saw it all, Lyra, and that's how we know.",未知
"""The consequence was a great lawsuit.",未知
"Your father en't the kind of man to deny or conceal the truth, and it left the judges with a problem.",未知
"He'd killed all right, he'd shed blood, but he was defending his home and his child against an intruder.",未知
"On t'other hand, the law allows any man to avenge the violation of his wife, and the dead man's lawyers argued that he were doing just that.",未知
"""The case lasted for weeks, with volumes of argument back and forth.",未知
"In the end the judges punished Lord Asriel by confiscating all his property and all his land, and left him a poor man; and he had been richer than a king.",未知
"""As for your mother, she wanted nothing to do with it, nor with you.",未知
She turned her back.,主谓宾
"The gyptian nurse told me she'd often been afeared of how your mother would treat you, because she was a proud and scornful woman.",未知
So much for her.,未知
"""Then there was you.",未知
"If things had fallen out different, Lyra, you might have been brought up a gyptian, because the nurse begged the court to let her have you; but we gyptians got little standing in the law.",未知
"The court decided you was to be placed in a priory, and so you were, with the Sisters of Obedience at Watlington.",未知
You won't remember.,未知
"""But Lord Asriel wouldn't stand for that.",未知
"He had a hatred of priors and monks and nuns, and being a high-handed man he just rode in one day and carried you off.",未知
"Not to look after himself, nor to give to the gyptians; he took you to Jordan College, and dared the law to undo it.",未知
"""Well, the law let things be.",未知
"Lord Asriel went back to his explorations, and you grew up at Jordan College.",未知
"The one thing he said, your father, the one condition he made, was that your mother shouldn't be let see you.",未知
"If she ever tried to do that, she was to be prevented, and he was to be told, because all the anger in his nature had turned against her now.",未知
The Master promised faithfully to do that; and so time passed.,未知
"""Then come all this anxiety about Dust.",未知
"And all over the country, all over the world, wise men and women too began a worrying about it.",未知
"It weren't of any account to us gyptians, until they started taking our kids.",未知
That's when we got interested.,未知
"And we got connections in all sorts of places you wouldn't imagine, including Jordan College.",未知
"You wouldn't know, but there's been someone a watching over you and reporting to us ever since you been there.",未知
"'Cause we got an interest in you, and that gyptian woman who nursed you, she never stopped being anxious on your behalf.""",未知
"""Who was it watching over me?""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"She felt immensely important and strange, that all her doings should be an object of concern so far away.",未知
"""It was a kitchen servant.",未知
"It was Bernie Johansen, the pastry cook.",主谓宾
"He's half-gyptian; you never knew that, I'll be bound.""",未知
"Bernie was a kindly, solitary man, one of those rare people whose daemon was the same sex as himself.",未知
It was Bernie she'd shouted at in her despair when Roger was taken.,主谓宾
And Bernie had been telling the gyptians everything!,未知
She marveled.,未知
"""So anyway,"" John Faa went on, ""we heard about you going away from Jordan College, and how it came about at a time when Lord Asriel was imprisoned and couldn't prevent it.",未知
"And we remembered what he'd said to the Master that he must never do, and we remembered that the man your mother had married, the politician Lord Asriel killed, was called Edward Coulter.""",未知
"""Mrs.",未知
"Coulter?""",未知
"said Lyra, quite stupefied.",未知
"""She en't my mother?""",未知
"""She is.",未知
"And if your father had been free, she wouldn't never have dared to defy him, and you'd still be at Jordan, not knowing a thing.",未知
But what the Master was a doing letting you go is a mystery I can't explain.,未知
He was charged with your care.,未知
"All I can guess is that she had some power over him.""",未知
Lyra suddenly understood the Master's curious behavior on the morning she'd left.,未知
"""But he didn't want to..."" she said, trying to remember it exactly.",未知
"""He...I had to go and see him first thing that morning, and I mustn't tell Mrs.",未知
"Coulter....It was like he wanted to protect me from her..."" She stopped, and looked at the two men carefully, and then decided to tell them the whole truth about the Retiring Room.",未知
"""See, there was something else.",未知
"That evening I hid in the Retiring Room, I saw the Master try to poison Lord Asriel.",未知
I saw him put some powder in the wine and I told my uncle and he knocked the decanter off the table and spilled it.,主谓宾
So I saved his life.,未知
"I could never understand why the Master would want to poison him, because he was always so kind.",未知
"Then on the morning I left he called me in early to his study, and I had to go secretly so no one would know, and he said..."" Lyra racked her brains to try and remember exactly what it was the Master had said.",未知
No good; she shook her head.,未知
"""The only thing I could understand was that he gave me something and I had to keep it secret from her, from Mrs. Coulter.",未知
"I suppose it's all right if I tell you....""
She felt in the pocket of the wolfskin coat and took out the velvet package.",主谓宾
"She laid it on the table, and she sensed John Faa's massive simple curiosity and Farder Coram's bright flickering intelligence both trained on it like searchlights.",主谓宾
"When she laid the alethiometer bare, it was Farder Coram who spoke first.",未知
"""I never thought I'd ever set eyes on one of them again.",未知
That's a symbol reader.,未知
"Did he tell you anything about it, child?""",未知
"""No.",未知
Only that I'd have to work out how to read it by myself.,未知
"And he called it an alethiometer.""",未知
"""What's that mean?""",未知
"said John Faa, turning to his companion.",未知
"""That's a Greek word.",未知
"I reckon it's from aktheia, which means truth.",主谓宾
It's a truth measure.,未知
"And have you worked out how to use it?""",未知
he said to her.,未知
"""No.",未知
"Least, I can make the three short hands point to different pictures, but I can't do anything with the long one.",未知
It goes all over.,未知
"Except sometimes, right, sometimes when I'm sort of concentrating, I can make the long needle go this way or that just by thinking it.""",未知
"""What's it do, Farder Coram?""",未知
said John Faa.,未知
"""And how do you read it?""",未知
"""All these pictures round the rim,"" said Farder Coram, holding it delicately toward John Faa's blunt strong gaze, ""they're symbols, and each one stands for a whole series of things.",未知
"Take the anchor, there.",未知
"The first meaning of that is hope, because hope holds you fast like an anchor so you don't give way.",未知
The second meaning is steadfastness.,未知
"The third meaning is snag, or prevention.",未知
The fourth meaning is the sea.,未知
"And so on, down to ten, twelve, maybe a never-ending series of meanings.""",未知
"""And do you know them all?""",未知
"""I know some, but to read it fully I'd need the book.",未知
"I seen the book and I know where it is, but I en't got it.""",未知
"""We'll come back to that,"" said John Faa.",未知
"""Go on with how you read it.""",未知
"""You got three hands you can control,"" Farder Coram explained, ""and you use them to ask a question.",未知
"By pointing to three symbols you can ask any question you can imagine, because you've got so many levels of each one.",未知
"Once you got your question framed, the other needle swings round and points to more symbols that give you the answer.""",未知
"""But how does it know what level you're a thinking of when you set the question?""",未知
said John Faa.,未知
"""Ah, by itself it don't.",未知
It only works if the questioner holds the levels in their mind.,未知
"You got to know all the meanings, first, and there must be a thousand or more.",未知
"Then you got to be able to hold 'em in your mind without fretting at it or pushing for an answer, and just watch while the needle wanders.",未知
"When it's gone round its full range, you'll know what the answer is.",未知
"I know how it works because I seen it done once by a wise man in Uppsala, and that's the only time I ever saw one before.",未知
"Do you know how rare these are?""",未知
"""The Master told me there was only six made,"" Lyra said.",未知
"""Whatever the number, it en't large.""",未知
"""And you kept this secret from Mrs. Coulter, like the Master told you?""",未知
said John Faa.,未知
"""Yes.",未知
"But her daemon, right, he used to go in my room.",未知
"And I'm sure he found it.""",未知
"""I see.",未知
"Well, Lyra, I don't know if we'll ever understand the full truth, but this is my guess, as good as I can make it.",未知
The Master was given a charge by Lord Asriel to look after you and keep you safe from your mother.,未知
"And that was what he did, for ten years or more.",未知
"Then Mrs. Coulter's friends in the Church helped her set up this Oblation Board, for what purpose we don't know, and there she was, as powerful in her way as Lord Asriel was in his.",未知
"Your parents, both strong in the world, both ambitious, and the Master of Jordan holding you in the balance between them.",未知
"""Now the Master's got a hundred things to look after.",未知
His first concern is his College and the scholarship there.,未知
"So if he sees a threat to that, he has to move agin it.",未知
"And the Church in recent times, Lyra, it's been a getting more commanding.",未知
"There's councils for this and councils for that; there's talk of reviving the Office of Inquisition, God forbid.",未知
And the Master has to tread warily between all these powers.,未知
"He has to keep Jordan College on the right side of the Church, or it won't survive.",未知
"""And another concern of the Master is you, child.",未知
Bernie Johansen was always clear about that.,未知
"The Master of Jordan and the other Scholars, they loved you like their own child.",未知
"They'd do anything to keep you safe, not just because they'd promised to Lord Asriel that they would, but for your own sake.",未知
"So if the Master gave you up to Mrs. Coulter when he'd promised Lord Asriel he wouldn't, he must have thought you'd be safer with her than in Jordan College, in spite of all appearances.",未知
"And when he set out to poison Lord Asriel, he must have thought that what Lord Asriel was a doing would place all of them in danger, and maybe all of us, too; maybe all the world.",未知
"I see the Master as a man having terrible choices to make; whatever he chooses will do harm, but maybe if he does the right thing, a little less harm will come about than if he chooses wrong.",未知
God preserve me from having to make that sort of choice.,主谓宾
"""And when it come to the point where he had to let you go, he gave you the symbol reader and bade you keep it safe.",未知
"I wonder what he had in mind for you to do with it; as you couldn't read it, I'm foxed as to what he was a thinking.""",未知
"""He said Uncle Asriel presented the alethiometer to Jordan College years before,"" Lyra said, struggling to remember.",未知
"""He was going to say something else, and then someone knocked at the door and he had to stop.",未知
"What I thought was, he might have wanted me to keep it away from Lord Asriel too.""",未知
"""Or even the opposite,"" said John Faa.",未知
"""What d'you mean, John?""",未知
said Farder Coram.,未知
"""He might have had it in mind to ask Lyra to return it to Lord Asriel, as a kind of recompense for trying to poison him.",未知
He might have thought the danger from Lord Asriel had passed.,未知
Or that Lord Asriel could read some wisdom from this instrument and hold back from his purpose.,未知
"If Lord Asriel's held captive now, it might help set him free.",未知
"Well, Lyra, you better take this symbol reader and keep it safe.",未知
"If you kept it safe so far, I en't worried about leaving it with you.",未知
"But there might come a time when we need to consult it, and I reckon we'll ask for it then.""",未知
He folded the velvet over it and slid it back across the table.,未知
"Lyra wanted to ask all kinds of questions, but suddenly she felt shy of this massive man, with his little eyes so sharp and kindly among their folds and wrinkles.",未知
"One thing she had to ask, though.",未知
"""Who was the gyptian woman who nursed me ?""",未知
"""Why, it was Billy Costa's mother, of course.",未知
"She won't have told you, because I en't let her, but she knows what we're a talking of here, so it's all out in the open.",未知
"""Now you best be getting back to her.",未知
"You got plenty to be a thinking of, child.",未知
"When three days is gone past, we'll have another roping and discuss all there is to do.",未知
You be a good girl.,未知
"Goodnight, Lyra.""",未知
"""Goodnight, Lord Faa.",未知
"Goodnight, Farder Coram,"" she said politely, clutching the alethiometer to her breast with one hand and scooping up Pantalaimon with the other.",未知
Both old men smiled kindly at her.,未知
"Outside the door of the parley room Ma Costa was waiting, and as if nothing had happened since Lyra was born, the boat mother gathered her into her great arms and kissed her before bearing her off to bed.",未知
"EIGHT

FRUSTRATION




Lyra had to adjust to her new sense of her own story, and that couldn't be done in a day.",未知
"To see Lord Asriel as her father was one thing, but to accept Mrs. Coulter as her mother was nowhere near so easy.",未知
"A couple of months ago she would have rejoiced, of course, and she knew that too, and felt confused.",未知
"But, being Lyra, she didn't fret about it for long, for there was the fen town to explore and many gyptian children to amaze.",未知
"Before the three days were up she was an expert with a punt (in her eyes, at least) and she'd gathered a gang of urchins about her with tales of her mighty father, so unjustly made captive.",未知
"""And then one evening the Turkish Ambassador was a guest at Jordan for dinner.",未知
"And he was under orders from the Sultan hisself to kill my father, right, and he had a ring on his finger with a hollow stone full of poison.",未知
"And when the wine come round he made as if to reach across my father's glass, and he sprinkled the poison in.",未知
"It was done so quick that no one else saw him, but-""
""What sort of poison?""",未知
demanded a thin-faced girl.,未知
"""Poison out of a special Turkish serpent,"" Lyra invented, ""what they catch by playing a pipe to lure out and then they throw it a sponge soaked in honey and the serpent bites it and can't get his fangs free, and they catch it and milk the venom out of it.",未知
"Anyway, my father seen what the Turk done, and he says, Gentlemen, I want to propose a toast of friendship between Jordan College and the College of Izmir, which was the college the Turkish Ambassador belonged to.",未知
"And to show our willingness to be friends, he says, we'll swap glasses and drink each other's wine.",未知
"""And the Ambassador was in a fix then, 'cause he couldn't refuse to drink without giving deadly insult, and he couldn't drink it because he knew it was poisoned.",未知
He went pale and he fainted right away at the table.,主谓宾
"And when he come round they was all still sitting there, waiting and looking at him.",未知
"And then he had to either drink the poison or own up.""",未知
"""So what did he do?""",未知
"""He drunk it.",未知
"It took him five whole minutes to die, and he was in torment all the time.""",未知
"""Did you see it happen?""",未知
"""No, 'cause girls en't allowed at the High Table.",未知
But I seen his body afterwards when they laid him out.,未知
"His skin was all withered like an old apple, and his eyes were starting from his head.",未知
"In fact, they had to push 'em back in the sockets....""
And so on.",未知
"Meanwhile, around the edges of the fen country, the police were knocking at doors, searching attics and outhouses, inspecting papers and interrogating everyone who claimed to have seen a blond little girl; and in Oxford the search was even fiercer.",未知
"Jordan College was scoured from the dustiest boxroom to the darkest cellar, and so were Gabriel and St. Michael's, till the heads of all the colleges issued a joint protest asserting their ancient rights.",未知
The only notion Lyra had of the search for her was the incessant drone of the gas engines of airships crisscrossing the skies.,未知
"They weren't visible, because the clouds were low and by statute airships had to keep a certain height above fen country, but who knew what cunning spy devices they might carry?",未知
"Best to keep under cover when she heard them, or wear the oilskin sou'wester over her bright distinctive hair.",未知
And she questioned Ma Costa about every detail of the story of her birth.,未知
"She wove the details into a mental tapestry even clearer and sharper than the stories she made up, and lived over and over again the flight from the cottage, the concealment in the closet, the harsh-voiced challenge, the clash of swords-
""Swords?",未知
"Great God, girl, you dreaming?""",未知
Ma Costa said.,未知
"""Mr. Coulter had a gun, and Lord Asriel knocked it out his hand and struck him down with one blow.",未知
Then there was two shots.,未知
"I wonder you don't remember; you ought to, little as you were.",主谓宾
"The first shot was Edward Coulter, who reached his gun and fired, and the second was Lord Asriel, who tore it out his grasp a second time and turned it on him.",未知
Shot him right between the eyes and dashed his brains out.,未知
"Then he says cool as paint, 'Come out, Mrs. Costa, and bring the baby,' because you were setting up such a howl, you and that daemon both; and he took you up and dandled you and sat you on his shoulders, walking up and down in high good humor with the dead man at his feet, and called for wine and bade me swab the floor.""",未知
"By the end of the fourth repetition of the story Lyra was perfectly convinced she did remember it, and even volunteered details of the color of Mr. Coulter's coat and the cloaks and furs hanging in the closet.",未知
Ma Costa laughed.,未知
"And whenever she was alone, Lyra took out the alethiome-ter and pored over it like a lover with a picture of the beloved.",未知
"So each image had several meanings, did it?",未知
Why shouldn't she work them out?,特殊疑问句
Wasn't she Lord Asriel's daughter?,未知
"Remembering what Farder Coram had said, she tried to focus her mind on three symbols taken at random, and clicked the hands round to point at them, and found that if she held the alethiometer just so in her palms and gazed at it in a particular lazy way, as she thought of it, the long needle
would begin to move more purposefully.",未知
Instead of its wayward divagations around the dial it swung smoothly from one picture to another.,未知
"Sometimes it would pause at three, sometimes two, sometimes five or more, and although she understood nothing of it, she gained a deep calm enjoyment from it, unlike anything she'd known.",未知
"Pantalaimon would crouch over the dial, sometimes as a cat, sometimes as a mouse, swinging his head round after the needle; and once or twice the two of them shared a glimpse of meaning that felt as if a shaft of sunlight had struck through clouds to light up a majestic line of great hills in the distance-something far beyond, and never suspected.",未知
And Lyra thrilled at those times with the same deep thrill she'd felt all her life on hearing the word North.,未知
"So the three days passed, with much coming and going between the multitude of boats and the Zaal.",未知
And then came the evening of the second roping.,未知
"The hall was more crowded than before, if that was possible.",未知
"Lyra and the Costas got there in time to sit at the front, and as soon as the flickering lights showed that the place was crammed, John Faa and Farder Coram came out on the platform and sat behind the table.",未知
"John Faa didn't have to make a sign for silence; he just put his great hands flat on the table and looked at the people below, and the hubbub died.",未知
"""Well,"" he said, ""you done what I asked.",未知
And better than I hoped.,未知
I'm a going to call on the heads of the six families now to come up here and give over their gold and recount their promises.,未知
"Nicholas Rokeby, you come first.""",未知
A stout black-bearded man climbed onto the platform and laid a heavy leather bag on the table.,未知
"""That's our gold,"" he said.",未知
"""And we offer thirty-eight men.""",未知
"""Thank you, Nicholas,"" said John Faa.",未知
Farder Coram was making a note.,未知
"The first man stood at the back of the platform as John Faa called for the next, and the next, and each came up, laid a bag on the table, and announced the number of men he could muster.",未知
"The Costas were part of the Stefanski family, and naturally Tony had been one of the first to volunteer.",未知
Lyra noticed his hawk daemon shifting from foot to foot and spreading her wings as the Stefanski money and the promise of twenty-three men were laid before John Faa.,主谓宾
"When the six family heads had all come up, Farder Coram showed his piece of paper to John Faa, who stood up to address the audience again.",未知
"""Friends, that's a muster of one hundred and seventy men.",未知
I thank you proudly.,主谓宾
"As for the gold, I make no doubt from the weight of it that you've all dug deep in your coffers, and my warm thanks go out for that as well.",未知
"""What we're a going to do next is this.",未知
"We're a going to charter a ship and sail north, and find them kids and set 'em free.",未知
"From what we know, there might be some fighting to do.",未知
"It won't be the first time, nor it won't be the last, but we never had to fight yet with people who kidnap children, and we shall have to be uncommon cunning.",未知
But we en't going to come back without our kids.,未知
"Yes, Dirk Vries?""",未知
"A man stood up and said, ""Lord Faa, do you know why they captured them kids?""",未知
"""We heard it's a theological matter.",未知
"They're making an experiment, but what nature it is we don't know.",未知
"To tell you all the truth, we don't even know whether any harm is a coming to 'em.",未知

"Yes, Raymond van Gerrit?""",未知
"The man who'd spoken at the first meeting stood up and said, ""That child, Lord Faa, the one you spoke of as being sought, the one as is sitting in the front row now.",未知
"I heard as all the folk living around the edge of the fens is having their
houses turned upside down on her account.",未知
I heard there's a move in Parliament this very day to rescind our ancient privileges on account of this child.,未知
"Yes, friends,"" he said, over the babble of shocked whispers, ""they're a going to pass a law doing away with our right to free movement in and out the fens.",未知
"Now, Lord Faa, what we want to know is this: who is this child on account of which we might come to such a pass?",未知
"She en't a gyptian child, not as I heard.",未知
"How comes it that a landloper child can put us all in danger?""",未知
Lyra looked up at John Faa's massive frame.,未知
Her heart was thumping so much she could hardly hear the first words of his reply.,未知
"""Now spell it out, Raymond, don't be shy,"" he said.",未知
"""You want us to give this child up to them she's a fleeing from, is that right?""",未知

"""Well, perhaps you would, and perhaps you wouldn't,"" John Faa continued.",未知
"""But if any man or woman needs a reason for doing good, ponder on this.",未知
"That little girl is the daughter of Lord Asriel, no less.",未知

"John Faa waited for silence, and said:
""Nothing will hold my hand, Margaret, save only judgment.",未知

To strike a day too soon is as bad as striking a hundred miles off.,未知
"To be sure, there's a warm passion behind what you say.",未知

And the time will come under judgment.,未知
Not under passion.,未知
"""Is there anyone else who wants to speak?",未知
"Speak if you will.""",未知
"But no one did, and presently John Faa reached for the closing bell and rang it hard and loud, swinging it high and shaking the peals out of it so that they filled the hall and rang the rafters.",未知
John Faa and the other men left the platform for the parley room.,未知
Lyra was a little disappointed.,未知

THE SPIES




Over the next few days, Lyra concocted a dozen plans and dismissed them impatiently; for they all boiled down to stowing away, and how could you stow away on a narrowboat?",未知
"To be sure, the real voyage would involve a proper ship, and she knew enough stories to expect all kinds of hiding places on a full-sized vessel: the lifeboats, the hold, the bilges, whatever they were; but she'd have to get to the ship first, and leaving the fens meant traveling the gyptian way.",未知
"And even if she got to the coast on her own, she might stow away on the wrong ship.",未知
It would be a fine thing to hide in a lifeboat and wake up on the way to High Brazil.,未知
"Meanwhile, all around her the tantalizing work of assembling the expedition was going on day and night.",未知
"She hung around Adam Stefanski, watching as he made his choice of the volunteers for the fighting force.",未知
She pestered Roger van Poppel with suggestions about the stores they needed to take: Had he remembered snow goggles?,未知
Did he know the best place to get arctic maps?,一般疑问句
"The man she most wanted to help was Benjamin de Ruyter, the spy.",未知
"But he had slipped away in the early hours of the morning after the second roping, and naturally no one could say where he'd gone or when he'd return.",未知
"So in default, Lyra attached herself to Farder Coram.",未知
"""I think it'd be best if I helped you, Farder Coram,"" she said, ""because I probably know more about the Gobblers than anyone else, being as I was nearly one of them.",未知
"Probably you'll need me to help you understand Mr. de Ruyter's messages.""",未知
"He took pity on the fierce, desperate little girl and didn't send her away.",主谓宾
"Instead he talked to her, and listened to her memories of Oxford and of Mrs. Coulter, and watched as she read the alethiometer.",未知
"""Where's that book with all the symbols in?""",未知
she asked him one day.,主谓宾
"""In Heidelberg,"" he said.",未知
"""And is there just the one?""",未知
"""There may be others, but that's the one I've seen.""",未知
"""I bet there's one in Bodley's Library in Oxford,"" she said.",未知
"She could hardly take her eyes off Farder Coram's daemon, who was the most beautiful daemon she'd ever seen.",未知
"When Pantalaimon was a cat, he was lean and ragged and harsh, but Sophonax, for that was her name, was golden-eyed and elegant beyond measure, fully twice as large as a real cat and richly furred.",未知
"When the sunlight touched her, it lit up more shades of tawny-brown-leaf-hazel-corn-gold-autumn-mahogany than Lyra could name.",未知
"She longed to touch that fur, to rub her cheeks against it, but of course she never did; for it was the grossest breach of etiquette imaginable to touch another person's daemon.",未知
"Daemons might touch each other, of course, or fight; but the prohibition against human-daemon contact went so deep that even in battle no warrior would touch an enemy's daemon.",未知
It was utterly forbidden.,未知
"Lyra couldn't remember having to be told that: she just knew it, as instinctively as she felt that nausea was bad and comfort good.",未知
"So although she admired the fur of Sophonax and even speculated on what it might feel like, she never made the slightest move to touch her, and never would.",未知
Sophonax was as sleek and healthy and beautiful as Farder Coram was ravaged and weak.,未知
"He might have been ill, or he might have suffered a crippling blow, but the result was that
he could not walk without leaning on two sticks, and he trembled constantly like an aspen leaf.",未知
"His mind was sharp and clear and powerful, though, and soon Lyra came to love him for his knowledge and for the firm way he directed her.",未知
"""What's that hourglass mean, Farder Coram?""",未知
"she asked, over the alethiometer, one sunny morning in his boat.",未知
"""It keeps coming back to that.""",未知
"""There's often a clue there if you look more close.",未知

"""D'you know what I noticed, Farder Coram?",未知
The needle stops there on the second go-round!,未知

"""Probably.",未知
"What are you asking it, Lyra?""",未知
"""I'm a thinking-"" she stopped, surprised to find that she'd actually been asking a question without realizing it.",未知
"""I just put three pictures together because...!",未知
"was thinking about Mr. de Ruyter, see....And I put together the serpent and the crucible and the beehive, to ask how he's a getting on with his spying, and-""
""Why them three symbols?""",未知
"""Because I thought the serpent was cunning, like a spy ought to be, and the crucible could mean like knowledge, what you kind of distill, and the beehive was hard work, like bees are always working hard; so out of the hard work and the cunning comes the knowledge, see, and that's the spy's job; and I pointed to them and I thought the question in my mind, and the needle stopped at death....D'you think that could be really working, Farder Coram?""",未知
"""It's working all right, Lyra.",未知
What we don't know is whether we're reading it right.,未知
That's a subtle art.,未知
"I wonder if-""
Before he could finish his sentence, there was an urgent knock at the door, and a young gyptian man came in.",未知
"""Beg pardon, Farder Coram, there's Jacob Huismans just come back, and he's sore wounded.""",未知

"""You better come, Farder Coram, 'cause he won't last long, he's a bleeding inside.""",未知
"Farder Coram and Lyra exchanged a look of alarm and wonderment, but only for a second, and then Farder Coram was hobbling out on his sticks as fast as he could manage, with his daemon padding ahead of him.",未知

"The young man led them to a boat tied up at the sugar-beet jetty, where a woman in a red flannel apron held open the door for them.",未知

"She was a ferret, and she lay very still beside his head, curled up but not asleep, for her eyes were open and glazed like his.",未知
"""What happened?""",未知
said Farder Coram.,未知
"""Benjamin's dead,"" came the answer.",未知
"""He's dead, and Gerard's captured.""",未知
His voice was hoarse and his breath was shallow.,未知
"When he stopped speaking, his daemon uncurled painfully and licked his cheek, and taking strength from that he went on:
""We was breaking into the Ministry of Theology, because Benjamin had heard from one of the Gobblers we caught that the headquarters was there, that's where all the orders was coming from....""
He stopped again.",未知
"""You captured some Gobblers?""",未知

""Benjamin and Gerard and us went to the Ministry at White Hall and found a little side door, it not being fiercely guarded, and we stayed on watch outside while they unfastened the lock and went in.",未知
"They hadn't been in but a minute when we heard a cry of fear, and Benjamin's daemon came a flying out and beckoned to us for help and flew in again, and we took our knife and ran in after her; only the place was dark, and full of wild forms and sounds that were confusing in their frightful movements; and we cast about, but there was a commotion above, and a fearful cry, and Benjamin and his daemon fell from a high staircase above us, his daemon a tugging and a fluttering to hold him up, but all in vain, for they crashed on the stone floor and both perished in a moment.",未知
"""And we couldn't see anything of Gerard, but there was a howl from above in his voice and we were too terrified and stunned to move, and then an arrow shot down at our shoulder and pierced deep down within....""

"Farder Coram leaned forward and gently pulled back the counterpane, and there protruding from Jacob's shoulder was the feathered end of an arrow in a mass
of clotted blood.",未知

She had seen it when she accompanied the Librarian of Jordan to a service there.,未知
"At the height of the invocation the Intercessor lifted the cloth to reveal in the dimness a glass dome inside which there was something too distant to see, until he pulled a string attached to a shutter above, letting a ray of sunlight through to strike the dome exactly.",未知
"Then it became clear: a little thing like a weathervane, with four sails black on one side and white on the other, that began to whirl around as the light struck it.",未知

And I'm sorry to say that poor Jacob has just died.,未知
"I think we're going to have to take you with us after all, against my inclinations.",主谓宾
"I'm troubled in my mind about it, but there don't seem to be any alternative.",未知
"As soon as Jacob's buried according to custom, we'll take our way.",未知
"You understand me, Lyra: you're a coming too, but it en't an occasion for joy or jubilation.",主谓宾
There's trouble and danger ahead for all of us.,未知
"""I'm a putting you under Farder Coram's wing.",未知
"Don't you be a trouble or a hazard to him, or you'll be a feeling the force of my wrath.",未知
"Now cut along and explain to Ma Costa, and hold yourself in readiness to leave.""",未知
The next two weeks passed more busily than any time of Lyra's life so far.,未知
"Busily, but not quickly, for there were tedious stretches of waiting, of hiding in damp crabbed closets, of watching a dismal rain-soaked autumn landscape roll past the window, of hiding again, of sleeping near the gas fumes of the engine and waking with a sick headache, and worst of all, of never once being allowed out into the air to run along the bank or clamber over the deck or haul at the lock gates or catch a mooring rope thrown from the lockside.",未知
"Because, of course, she had to remain hidden.",未知
"Tony Costa told her of the gossip in the waterside pubs: that there was a hunt the length of the kingdom for a little fair-haired girl, with a big reward for her discovery and severe punishment for anyone concealing her.",未知
"There were strange rumors too: people said she was the only child to have escaped from the Gobblers, and she had terrible secrets in her possession.",there be句型
"Another rumor said she wasn't a human child at all but a pair of spirits in the form of child and daemon, sent to this world by the infernal powers in order to work great ruin; and yet another rumor said it was no child but a fully grown human, shrunk by magic and in the pay of the Tartars, come to spy on good English people and prepare the way for a Tartar invasion.",未知
Lyra heard these tales at first with glee and later with despondency.,未知
All those people hating and fearing her!,未知
And she longed to be out of this narrow boxy cabin.,未知
"She longed to be north already, in the wide snows under the blazing Aurora.",未知
"And sometimes she longed to be back at Jordan College, scrambling over the roofs with Roger with the Steward's bell tolling half an hour to dinnertime and the clatter and sizzle and shouting of the kitchen....Then she wished passionately that nothing had changed, nothing would ever change, that she could be Lyra of Jordan College forever and ever.",未知
The one thing that drew her out of her boredom and irritation was the alethiometer.,未知
"She read it every day, sometimes with Farder Coram and sometimes on her own, and she found that she could sink more and more readily into the calm state in which the symbol meanings clarified themselves, and those great mountain ranges touched by sunlight emerged into vision.",主谓宾
She struggled to explain to Farder Coram what it felt like.,未知
"""It's almost like talking to someone, only you can't quite hear them, and you feel kind of stupid because they're cleverer than you, only they don't get cross or any thing.... And they know such a lot, Farder Coram!",未知
"As if they knew everything, almost!",未知
"Mrs. Coulter was clever, she knew ever such a lot, but this is a different kind of knowing....It's like understanding, I suppose....""
He would ask specific questions, and she would search for answers.",未知
"""What's Mrs. Coulter doing now?""",未知
"he'd say, and her hands would move at once, and he'd say, ""Tell me what you're doing.""",未知
"""Well, the Madonna is Mrs. Coulter, and I think my mother when I put the hand there; and the ant is busy-that's easy, that's the top meaning; and the hourglass has got time in its meanings, and partway down there's now, and I just fix my mind on it.""",未知
"""And how do you know where these meanings are?""",未知
"""I kind of see 'em.",未知
"Or feel 'em rather, like climbing down a ladder at night, you put your foot down and there's another rung.",未知
"Well, I put my mind down and there's another meaning, and I kind of sense what it is.",未知
Then I put 'em all together.,未知
"There's a trick in it like focusing your eyes.""",未知
"""Do that then, and see what it says.""",未知
Lyra did.,未知
"The long needle began to swing at once, and stopped, moved on, stopped again in a precise series of sweeps and pauses.",未知
"It was a sensation of such grace and power that Lyra, sharing it, felt like a young bird learning to fly.",未知
"Farder Coram, watching from across the table, noted the places where the needle stopped, and watched the little girl holding her hair back from her face and biting her lower lip just a little, her eyes following the needle at first but then, when its path was settled, looking elsewhere on the dial.",未知
"Not randomly, though.",未知
"Farder Coram was a chess player, and he knew how chess players looked at a game in play.",未知
"An expert player seemed to see lines of force and influence on the board, and looked along the important lines and ignored the weak ones; and Lyra's eyes moved the same way, according to some similar magnetic field that she could see and he couldn't.",未知
"The needle stopped at the thunderbolt, the infant, the serpent, the elephant, and at a creature Lyra couldn't find a name for: a sort of lizard with big eyes and a tail curled around the twig it stood on.",未知
"It repeated the sequence time after time, while Lyra watched.",未知
"""What's that lizard mean?""",未知
"said Farder Coram, breaking into her concentration.",未知
"""It don't make sense....!",未知
"can see what it says, but I must be misreading it.",未知
"The thunderbolt I think is anger, and the child ...I think it's me...l was getting a meaning for that lizard thing, but you talked to me, Farder Coram, and I lost it.",未知
"See, it's just floating any old where.""",未知
"""Yes, I see that.",未知
"I'm sorry, Lyra.",未知
You tired now?,未知
"D'you want to stop?""",未知
"""No, I don't,"" she said, but her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright.",未知
"She had all the signs of fretful overexcitement, and it was made worse by her long confinement in this stuffy cabin.",未知
He looked out of the window.,未知
"It was nearly dark, and they were traveling along the last stretch of inland water before reaching the coast.",未知
"Wide brown scummed expanses of an estuary extended under a dreary sky to a distant group of coal-spirit tanks, rusty and cobwebbed with pipework, beside a refinery where a thick smear of smoke ascended reluctantly to join the clouds.",未知
"""Where are we?""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""Can I go outside just for a bit, Farder Coram?""",未知
"""This is Colby water,"" he said.",未知
"""The estuary of the river Cole.",未知
"When we reach the town, we'll tie up by the Smoke-market and go on foot to the docks.",未知
"We'll be there in an hour or two....""
But it was getting dark, and in the wide desolation of the creek nothing was moving but their own boat and a distant coal barge laboring toward the refinery; and Lyra was so flushed and tired, and she'd been inside for so long; and so Farder Coram went on:
""Well, I don't suppose it'll matter just for a few minutes in the open air.",未知
"I wouldn't call it fresh; ten't fresh except when it's blowing off the sea; but you can sit out on top and look around till we get closer in.""",未知
"Lyra leaped up, and Pantalaimon became a seagull at once, eager to stretch his wings in the open.",未知
"It was cold outside, and although she was well wrapped up, Lyra was soon shivering.",未知
"Pantalaimon, on the other hand, leaped into the air with a loud caw of delight, and wheeled and skimmed and darted now ahead of the boat, now behind the stern.",未知
"Lyra exulted in it, feeling with him as he flew, and urging him mentally to provoke the old tillerman's cormorant daemon into a race.",未知
But she ignored him and settled down sleepily on the handle of the tiller near her man.,未知
"There was no life out on this bitter brown expanse, and only the steady chug of the engine and the subdued splashing of the water under the bows broke the wide silence.",there be句型
Heavy clouds hung low without offering rain; the air beneath was grimy with smoke.,未知
Only Pantalaimon's flashing elegance had anything in it of life and joy.,未知
"As he soared up out of a dive with wide wings white against the gray, something black hurtled at him and struck.",未知
"He fell sideways in a flutter of shock and pain, and Lyra cried out, feeling it sharply.",未知
"Another little black thing joined the first; they moved not like birds but like flying beetles, heavy and direct, and with a droning sound.",未知
"As Pantalaimon fell, trying to twist away and make for the boat and Lyra's desperate arms, the black things kept driving into him, droning, buzzing, and murderous.",未知
"Lyra was nearly mad with Pantalaimon's fear and her own, but then something swept past her and upward.",未知
"It was the tillerman's daemon, and clumsy and heavy as she looked, her flight was powerful and swift.",未知
"Her head snapped this way and that-there was a flutter of black wings, a shiver of white-and a little black thing fell to the tarred roof of the cabin at Lyra's feet just as Pantalaimon landed on her outstretched hand.",未知
"Before she could comfort him, he changed into his wildcat shape and sprang down on the creature, batting it back from the edge of the roof, where it was crawling swiftly to escape.",未知
"Pantalaimon held it firmly down with a needle-filled paw and looked up at the darkening sky, where the black wing flaps of the cormorant were circling higher as she cast around for the other.",主谓宾
"Then the cormorant glided swiftly back and croaked something to the tillerman, who said, ""It's gone.",未知
Don't let that other one escape.,未知
"Here-"" and he flung the dregs out of the tin mug he'd been drinking from, and tossed it to Lyra.",未知
She clapped it over the creature at once.,主谓宾
It buzzed and snarled like a little machine.,未知
"""Hold it still,"" said Farder Coram from behind her, and then he was kneeling to slip a piece of card under the mug.",未知
"""What is it, Farder Coram?""",未知
she said shakily.,未知
"""Let's go below and have a look.",未知
"Take it careful, Lyra.",未知
"Hold that tight.""",未知
"She looked at the tillerman's daemon as she passed, intending to thank her, but her old eyes were closed.",未知
She thanked the tillerman instead.,未知
"""You oughter stayed below"" was all he said.",未知
"She took the mug into the cabin, where Farder Coram had found a beer glass.",未知
"He held the tin mug upside down over it and then slipped the card out from between them, so that the creature fell into the glass.",未知
He held it up so they could see the angry little thing clearly.,主谓宾
"It was about as long as Lyra's thumb, and dark green, not black.",未知
"Its wing cases were erect, like a ladybird's about to fly, and the wings inside were beating so furiously that they were only a blur.",未知
Its six clawed legs were scrabbling on the smooth glass.,未知
"""What is it?""",未知
she said.,未知
"Pantalaimon, a wildcat still, crouched on the table six inches away, his green eyes following it round and round inside the glass.",未知
"""If you was to crack it open,"" said Farder Coram, ""you'd find no living thing in there.",未知
"No animal nor insect, at any rate.",未知
"I seen one of these things afore, and I never thought I'd see one again this far north.",未知
Afric things.,未知
"There's a clockwork running in there, and pinned to the spring of it, there's a bad spirit with a spell through its heart.""",未知
"""But who sent it?""",未知
"""You don't even need to read the symbols, Lyra; you can guess as easy as I can.""",未知
"""Mrs.",未知
"Coulter?""",未知
"'""Course.",未知
She en't only explored up north; there's strange things aplenty in the southern wild.,未知
It was Morocco where I saw one of these last.,主谓宾
"Deadly dangerous; while the spirit's in it, it won't never stop, and when you let the spirit free, it's so monstrous angry it'll kill the first thing it gets at.""",未知
"""But what was it after?""",未知
"""Spying.",未知
I was a cursed fool to let you up above.,未知
"And I should have let you think your way through the symbols without interrupting.""",未知
"""I see it now!""",未知
"said Lyra, suddenly excited.",未知
"""It means air, that lizard thing!",未知
"I saw that, but I couldn't see why, so I tried to work it out and I lost it.""",未知
"""Ah,"" said Farder Coram, ""then I see it too.",未知
"It en't a lizard, that's why; it's a chameleon.",未知
"And it stands for air because they don't eat nor drink, they just live on air.""",未知
"""And the elephant-""
""Africa,"" he said, and ""Aha.""",未知
They looked at each other.,未知
"With every revelation of the alethiometer's power, they became more awed by it.",未知
"""It was telling us about these things all the time,"" said Lyra.",未知
"""We oughter listened.",未知
"But what can we do about this un, Farder Coram?",未知
"Can we kill it or something?""",未知
"""I don't know as we can do anything.",未知
We shall just have to keep him shut up tight in a box and never let him out.,未知
"What worries me more is the other one, as got away.",未知
"He'll be a flying back to Mrs. Coulter now, with the news that he's seen you.",未知
"Damn me, Lyra, but I'm a fool.""",未知
He rattled about in a cupboard and found a smokeleaf tin about three inches in diameter.,未知
"It had been used for holding screws, but he tipped those out and wiped the inside with a rag before inverting the glass over it with the card still in place over the mouth.",未知
"After a tricky moment when one of the creature's legs escaped and thrust the tin away with surprising strength, they had it captured and the lid screwed down tight.",未知
"""As soon's we get about the ship I'll run some solder round the edge to make sure of it,"" Farder Coram said.",未知
"""But don't clockwork run down?""",未知
"""Ordinary clockwork, yes.",未知
"But like I said, this un's kept tight wound by the spirit pinned to the end.",未知
"The more he struggles, the tighter it's wound, and the stronger the force is.",未知
"Now let's put this feller out the way....""
He wrapped the tin in a flannel cloth to stifle the incessant buzzing and droning, and stowed it away under his bunk.",未知
"It was dark now, and Lyra watched through the window as the lights of Colby came closer.",未知
"The heavy air was thickening into mist, and by the time they tied up at the wharves alongside the Smokemarket everything in sight was softened and blurred.",未知
"The darkness shaded into pearly silver-gray veils laid over the warehouses and the cranes, the wooden market stalls and the granite many-chimneyed building the market was named after, where day and night fish hung kippering in the fragrant oakwood smoke.",未知
"The chimneys were contributing their thickness to the clammy air, and the pleasant reek of smoked herring and mackerel and haddock seemed to breathe out of the very cobbles.",未知
"Lyra, wrapped up in oilskin and with a large hood hiding her revealing hair, walked along between Farder Coram and the tillerman.",未知
"All three daemons were alert, scouting around corners ahead, watching behind, listening for the slightest footfall.",未知
But they were the only figures to be seen.,未知
"The citizens of Colby were all indoors, probably sipping jenniver beside roaring stoves.",未知
"They saw no one until they reached the dock, and the first man they saw there was Tony Costa, guarding the gates.",未知
"""Thank God you got here,"" he said quietly, letting them through.",未知
"""We just heard as Jack Verhoeven's been shot and his boat sunk, and no one'd heard where you was.",未知
"John Faa's on board already and jumping to go.""",未知
"The vessel looked immense to Lyra: a wheelhouse and funnel amidships, a high fo'c'sle and a stout derrick over a canvas-covered hatch; yellow light agleam in the portholes and the bridge, and white light at the masthead; and three or four men on deck, working urgently at things she couldn't see.",未知
"She hurried up the wooden gangway ahead of Farder Coram, and looked around with excitement.",未知
"Pantalaimon became a monkey and clambered up the derrick at once, but she called him down again; Farder Coram wanted them indoors, or below, as you called it on board ship.",未知
"Down some stairs, or a companionway, there was a small saloon where John Faa was talking quietly with Nicholas Rokeby, the gyptian in charge of the vessel.",未知
John Faa did nothing hastily.,未知
"Lyra was waiting for him to greet her, but he finished his remarks about the tide and pilotage before turning to the incomers.",未知
"""Good evening, friends,"" he said.",未知
"""Poor Jack Verhoeven's dead, perhaps you've heard.",未知
"And his boys captured.""",未知
"""We have bad news too,"" said Farder Coram, and told of their encounter with the flying spirits.",未知
"John Faa shook his great head, but didn't reproach them.",未知
"""Where is the creature now?""",未知
he said.,未知
Farder Coram took out the leaf tin and laid it on the table.,未知
Such a furious buzzing came from it that the tin itself moved slowly over the wood.,未知
"""I've heard of them clockwork devils, but never seen one,"" John Faa said.",未知
"""There en't no way of taming it and turning it back, I do know that much.",未知
"Nor is it any use weighing it down with lead and dropping it in the ocean, because one day it'd rust through and out the devil would come and make for the child wherever she was.",未知
"No, we'll have to keep it by, and exercise our vigilance.""",未知
"Lyra being the only female on board (for John Faa had decided against taking women, after much thought), she had a cabin to herself.",未知
"Not a grand cabin, to be sure; in fact, little more than a closet with a bunk and a scuttle, which was the proper name for porthole.",未知
"She stowed her few things in the drawer below the bunk and ran up excitedly to lean over the rail and watch England vanish behind, only to find that most of England had vanished in the mist before she got there.",主谓宾
"But the rush of water below, the movement in the air, the ship's lights glowing bravely in the dark, the rumble of the engine, the smells of salt and fish and coal spirit were exciting enough by themselves.",未知
"It wasn't long before another sensation joined them, as the vessel began to roll in the German Ocean swell.",未知
"When someone called Lyra down for a bite of supper, she found she was less hungry than she'd thought, and presently she decided it would be a good idea to lie down, for Pantalaimon's sake, because the poor creature was feeling sadly ill at ease.",未知
And so began her journey to the North.,未知
"PART   TWO


BOLVAHGAR

THE CONSUL AHD THE BEAR




John Faa and the other leaders had decided that they would make for Trollesund, the main port of Lapland.",未知
"The witches had a consulate in the town, and John Faa knew that without their help, or at least their friendly neutrality, it would be impossible to rescue the captive children.",未知
"He explained his idea to Lyra and Farder Coram the next day, when Lyra's seasickness had abated slightly.",主谓宾
"The sun was shining brightly and the green waves were dashing against the bows, bearing white streams of foam as they curved away.",未知
"Out on the deck, with the breeze blowing and the whole sea a-sparkle with light and movement, she felt little sickness at all; and now that Pantalaimon had discovered the delights of being a seagull and then a stormy petrel and skimming the wave tops, Lyra was too absorbed by his glee to wallow in landlubberly misery.",未知
"John Faa, Farder Coram, and two or three others sat in the stern of the ship, with the sun full on them, talking about what to do next.",未知
"""Now, Farder Coram knows these Lapland witches,"" John Faa said.",未知
"""And if I en't mistaken, there's an obligation there.""",未知
"""That's right, John,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""It were forty years back, but that's nothing to a witch.",未知
"Some of 'em live to many times that.""",未知
"""What happened to bring this obligation about, Farder Coram?""",未知
"said Adam Stefanski, the man in charge of the fighting troop.",未知
"""I saved a witch's life,"" Farder Coram explained.",未知
"""She fell out of the air, being pursued by a great red bird like to nothing I'd seen before.",未知
She fell injured in the marsh and I set out to find her.,未知
"She was like to drowning, and I got her on board and shot that bird down, and it fell into a bog, to my regret, for it was as big as a bittern, and flame-red.""",未知
"""Ah,"" the other men murmured, captured by Farder Coram's story.",未知
"""Now, when I got her in the boat,"" he went on, ""I had the most grim shock I'd ever known, because that young woman had no daemon.""",未知
"It was as if he'd said, ""She had no head.""",未知
The very thought was repugnant.,未知
"The men shuddered, their daemons bristled or shook themselves or cawed harshly, and the men soothed them.",未知
"Pantalaimon crept into Lyra's arms, their hearts beating together.",未知
"""At least,"" Farder Coram said, ""that's what it seemed.",未知
"Being as she'd fell out of the air, I more than suspected she was a witch.",未知
"She looked exactly like a young woman, thinner than some and prettier than most, but not seeing that daemon gave me a hideous turn.""",未知
"""En't they got daemons then, the witches?""",未知
"said the other man, Michael Canzona.",未知
"""Their daemons is invisible, I expect,"" said Adam Stefanski.",未知
"""He was there all the time, and Farder Coram never saw him.""",未知
"""No, you're wrong, Adam,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""He weren't there at all.",未知
The witches have the power to separate their-selves from their daemons a mighty sight further'n what we can.,未知
"If need be, they can send their daemons far abroad on the wind or the clouds, or down below the ocean.",未知
"And this witch I found, she hadn't been resting above an hour when her daemon came a flying back, because he'd felt her fear and her injury, of course.",未知
"And it's my belief, though she never admitted to this, that the great red bird I shot was another witch's daemon, in pursuit.",未知
Lord!,未知
"That made me shiver, when I thought of that.",未知
I'd have stayed my hand; I'd have taken any measures on sea or land; but there it was.,未知
"Anyway, there was no doubt I'd saved her life, and she gave me a token of it, and said I was to call on her help if ever it was needed.",未知
And once she sent me help when the Skraelings shot me with a poison arrow.,未知
"We had other connections, too....I haven't seen her from that day to this, but she'll remember.""",未知
"""And does she live at Trollesund, this witch?""",未知
"""No, no.",未知
"They live in forests and on the tundra, not in a seaport among men and women.",未知
Their business is with the wild.,未知
"But they keep a consul there, and I shall get word to her, make no doubt about that.""",未知
"Lyra was keen to know more about the witches, but the men had turned their talk to the matter of fuel and stores, and presently she grew impatient to see the rest of the ship.",未知
"She wandered along the deck toward the bows, and soon made the acquaintance of an able seaman by flicking at him the pips she'd saved from the apple she'd eaten at breakfast.",未知
"He was a stout and placid man, and when he'd sworn at her and been sworn at in return, they became great friends.",未知
He was called Jerry.,未知
"Under his guidance she found out that having something to do prevented you from feeling seasick, and that even a job like scrubbing a deck could be satisfying, if it was done in a seamanlike way.",未知
"She was very taken with this notion, and later on she folded the blankets on her bunk in a seamanlike way, and put her possessions in the closet in a seamanlike way, and used ""stow"" instead of ""tidy"" for the process of doing so.",未知
"After two days at sea, Lyra decided that this was the life for her.",未知
"She had the run of the ship, from the engine room to the bridge, and she was soon on first-name terms with all the crew.",未知
Captain Rokeby let her signal to a Hollands frigate by pulling the handle of the steam whistle; the cook suffered her help in mixing plum duff; and only a stern word from John Faa prevented her from climbing the foremast to inspect the horizon from the crow's nest.,未知
"All the time they were steaming north, and it grew colder daily.",未知
"The ship's stores were searched for oilskins that could be cut down for her, and Jerry showed her how to sew, an art she learned willingly from him, though she had scorned it at Jordan and avoided instruction from Mrs. Lonsdale.",未知
"Together they made a waterproof bag for the alethiometer that she could wear around her waist, in case she fell in the sea, she said.",未知
With it safely in place she clung to the rail in her oilskins and sou'wester as the stinging spray broke over the bows and surged along the deck.,未知
"She still felt seasick occasionally, especially when the wind got up and the ship plunged heavily over the crests of the gray-green waves, and then it was Pantalaimon's job to distract her from it by skimming the waves as a stormy petrel; because she could feel his boundless glee in the dash of wind and water, and forget her nausea.",未知
"From time to time he even tried being a fish, and once joined a school of dolphins, to their surprise and pleasure.",未知
"Lyra stood shivering in the fo'c'sle and laughed with delight as her beloved Pantalaimon, sleek and powerful, leaped from the water with half a dozen other swift gray shapes.",未知
"He had to stay close to the ship, of course, for he could never go far from her; but she sensed his desire to speed as far and as fast as he could, for pure exhilaration.",未知
"She shared his pleasure, but for her it wasn't simple pleasure, for there was pain and fear in it too.",主谓宾
Suppose he loved being a dolphin more than he loved being with her on land?,未知
What would she do then?,特殊疑问句

"Inside the harbor the water was calm, and as they moved past the massive breakwater Lyra began to feel unsteady from the lack of motion.",未知
She and Pantalaimon avidly watched as the ship inched ponderously toward the quayside.,未知
"During the next hour the sound of the engine died away to a quiet background rumble, voices shouted orders or queries, ropes were thrown, gangways lowered, hatches opened.",未知
"""Come on,  Lyra,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""Is everything packed?""",未知
"Lyra's possessions, such as they were, had been packed ever since she'd woken up and seen the land.",未知
"All she had to do was run to the cabin and pick up the shopping bag, and she was ready.",未知
The first thing she and Farder Coram did ashore was to visit the house of the witch consul.,未知
"It didn't take long to find it; the little town was clustered around the harbor, with the oratory and the governor's house the only buildings of any size.",未知
"The witch consul lived in a green-painted wooden house within sight of the sea, and when they rang the bell it jangled loudly in the quiet street.",未知
A servant showed them into a little parlor and brought them coffee.,未知
Presently the consul himself came in to greet them.,未知
"He was a fat man with a florid face and a sober black suit, whose name was Martin Lanselius.",未知
"His dsmon was a little serpent, the same intense and brilliant green as his eyes, which were the only witchlike thing about him, though Lyra was not sure what she had been expecting a witch to look like.",未知
"""How can I help you, Farder Coram?""",未知
he said.,未知
"""In two ways, Dr. Lanselius.",未知
"First, I'm anxious to get in touch with a witch lady I met some years ago, in the fen country of Eastern Anglia.",未知
"Her name is Serafina Pekkala.""",未知
Dr. Lanselius made a note with a silver pencil.,未知
"""How long ago was your meeting with her?""",未知
he said.,未知
"""Must be forty years.",未知
"But I think she would remember.""",未知
"""And what is the second way in which you seek my help?""",未知
"""I'm representing a number of gyptian families who've lost children.",未知
"We've got reason to believe there's an organization capturing these children, ours and others, and bringing them to the North for some unknown purpose.",未知
"I'd like to know whether you or your people have heard of anything like this a going on.""",未知
Dr. Lanselius sipped his coffee blandly.,未知
"""It's not impossible that notice of some such activity might have come our way,"" he said.",未知
"""You realize, the relations between my people and the Northlanders are perfectly cordial.",未知
"It would be difficult for me to justify disturbing them.""",未知
Farder Coram nodded as if he understood very well.,未知
"""To be sure,"" he said.",未知
"""And it wouldn't be necessary for me to ask you if I could get the information any other way.",未知
"That was why I asked about the witch lady first.""",未知
Now Dr. Lanselius nodded as if he understood.,未知
Lyra watched this game with puzzlement and respect.,未知
"There were all kinds of things going on beneath it, and she saw that the witch consul was coming to a decision.",there be句型
"""Very well,"" he said.",未知
"""Of course, that's true, and you'll realize that your name is not unknown to us, Farder Coram.",未知
Serafina Pekkala is queen of a witch clan in the region of Lake Enara.,未知
"As for your other question, it is of course understood that this information is not reaching you through me.""",未知
"""Quite so.""",未知
"""Well, in this very town there is a branch of an organization called the Northern Progress Exploration Company, which pretends to be searching for minerals, but which is really controlled by something called the General Oblation Board of London.",未知
"This organization, I happen to know, imports children.",未知
This is not generally known in the town; the Norroway government is not officially aware of it.,未知
The children don't remain here long.,未知
"They are taken some distance inland.""",未知
"""Do you know where, Dr.",未知
"Lanselius?""",未知
"""No.",未知
"I would tell you if I did.""",未知
"""And do you know what happens to them there?""",未知
"For the first time, Dr. Lanselius glanced at Lyra.",未知
She looked stolidly back.,未知
The little green serpent daemon raised her head from the consul's collar and whispered tongue-flickeringly in his ear.,未知
"The consul said, ""I have heard the phrase the M.aystadt process in connection with this matter.",未知
I think they use that in order to avoid calling what they do by its proper name.,主谓宾
"I have also heard the word intercision, but what it refers to I could not say.""",未知
"""And are there any children in the town at the moment?""",未知
said Farder Coram.,未知
He was stroking his daemon's fur as she sat alert in his lap.,未知
Lyra noticed that she had stopped purring.,未知
"""No, I think not,"" said Dr. Lanselius.",未知
"""A group of about twelve arrived a week ago and moved out the day before yesterday.""",未知
"""Ah!",未知
As recent as that?,未知
Then that gives us a bit of hope.,未知
"How did they travel, Dr.",未知
"Lanselius?""",未知
"""By sledge.""",未知
"""And you have no idea where they went?""",未知
"""Very little.",未知
"It is not a subject we are interested in.""",未知
"""Quite so.",未知
"Now, you've answered all my questions very fairly, sir, and here's just one more.",未知
"If you were me, what question would you ask of the Consul of the Witches?""",未知
For the first time Dr. Lanselius smiled.,未知
"""I would ask where I could obtain the services of an armored bear,"" he said.",未知
"Lyra sat up, and felt Pantalaimon's heart leap in her hands.",未知
"""I understood the armored bears to be in the service of the Oblation Board,"" said Farder Coram in surprise.",未知
"""I mean, the Northern Progress Company, or whatever they're calling themselves.""",未知
"""There is at least one who is not.",未知
You will find him at the sledge depot at the end of Langlokur Street.,未知
"He earns a living there at the moment, but such is his temper and the fear he engenders in the dogs, his employment might not last for long.""",未知
"""Is he a renegade, then?""",未知
"""It seems so.",未知
His name is lorek Byrnison.,未知
"You asked what I would ask, and I told you.",未知
"Now here is what I would do: I would seize the chance to employ an armored bear, even if it were far more remote than this.""",未知
Lyra could hardly sit still.,未知
"Farder Coram, however, knew the etiquette for meetings such as this, and took another spiced honey cake from the plate.",未知
"While he ate it, Dr. Lanselius turned to Lyra.",未知
"""I understand that you are in possession of an alethiome-ter,"" he said, to her great surprise; for how could he have known that?",未知
"""Yes,"" she said, and then, prompted by a nip from Pantalaimon, added, ""Would you like to look at it?""",未知
"""I should like that very much.""",未知
She fished inelegantly in the oilskin pouch and handed him the velvet package.,未知
"He unfolded it and held it up with great care, gazing at the face like a Scholar gazing at a rare manuscript.",主谓宾
"""How exquisite!""",未知
he said.,未知
"""I have seen one other example, but it was not so fine as this.",未知
"And do you possess the books of readings?""",未知
"""No,"" Lyra began, but before she could say any more, Farder Coram was speaking.",未知
"""No, the great pity is that although Lyra possesses the alethiometer itself, there's no means of reading it whatsoever,"" he said.",未知
"""It's just as much of a mystery as the pools of ink the Hindus use for reading the future.",未知
"And the nearest book of readings I know of is in the Abbey of St. Johann at Heidelberg.""",未知
Lyra could see why he was saying this: he didn't want Dr. Lanselius to know of Lyra's power.,未知
"But she could also see something Farder Coram couldn't, which was the agitation of Dr. Lanselius's daemon, and she knew at once that it was no good to pretend.",未知
"So she said, ""Actually, I can read it,"" speaking half to Dr. Lanselius and half to Farder Coram, and it was the consul who responded.",未知
"""That is wise of you,"" he said.",未知
"""Where did you obtain this one?""",未知
"""The Master of Jordan College in Oxford gave it to me,"" she said.",未知
"""Dr. Lanselius, do you know who made them?""",未知
"""They are said to originate in the city of Prague,"" said the consul.",未知
"""The Scholar who invented the first alethiometer was apparently trying to discover a way of measuring the influences of the planets, according to the ideas of astrology.",未知
He intended to make a device that would respond to the idea of Mars or Venus as a compass responds to the idea of North.,未知
"In that he failed, but the mechanism he invented was clearly responding to something, even if no one knew what it was.""",未知
"""And where did they get the symbols from?""",未知
"""Oh, this was in the seventeenth century.",未知
Symbols and emblems were everywhere.,未知
Buildings and pictures were designed to be read like books.,未知
"Everything stood for something else; if you had the right dictionary, you could read Nature itself.",未知
It was hardly surprising to find philosophers using the symbolism of their time to interpret knowledge that came from a mysterious source.,未知
"But, you know, they haven't been used seriously for two centuries or so.""",未知
"He handed the instrument back to Lyra, and added:
""May I ask a question?",未知
"Without the books of symbols, how do you read it?""",未知
"""I just make my mind go clear and then it's sort of like looking down into water.",未知
"You got to let your eyes find the right level, because that's the only one that's in focus.",未知
"Something like that,"" she said.",未知
"""I wonder if I might ask to see you do it?""",未知
he said.,未知
"Lyra looked at Farder Coram, wanting to say yes but waiting for his approval.",未知
The old man nodded.,未知
"""What shall I ask?""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""What are the intentions of the Tartars with regard to Kamchatka?""",未知
That wasn't hard.,未知
"Lyra turned the hands to the camel, which meant Asia, which meant Tartars; to the cornucopia, for Kamchatka, where there were gold mines; and to the ant, which meant activity, which meant purpose and intention.",未知
"Then she sat still, letting her mind hold the three levels of meaning together in focus, and relaxed for the answer, which came almost at once.",未知
"The long needle trembled on the dolphin, the helmet, the baby, and the anchor, dancing between them and onto the crucible in a complicated pattern that Lyra's eyes followed without hesitation, but which was incomprehensible to the two men.",未知
"When it had completed the movements several times, Lyra looked up.",未知
She blinked once or twice as if she were coming out of a trance.,未知
"""They're going to pretend to attack it, but they're not really going to, because it's too far away and they'd be too stretched out,"" she said.",未知
"""Would you tell me how you read that?""",未知
"""The dolphin, one of its deep-down meanings is playing, sort of like being playful,"" she explained.",未知
"""I know it's the fifteenth because it stopped fifteen times and it just got clear at that level but nowhere else.",未知
"And the helmet means war, and both together they mean pretend to go to war but not be serious.",未知
"And the baby means-it means difficult-it'd be too hard for them to attack it, and the anchor says why, because they'd be stretched out as tight as an anchor rope.",未知
"I just see it all like that, you see.""",未知
Dr. Lanselius nodded.,未知
"""Remarkable,"" he said.",未知
"""I am very grateful.",未知
"I shall not forget that.""",未知
"Then he looked strangely at Farder Coram, and back at Lyra.",未知
"""Could I ask you for one more demonstration?""",未知
he said.,未知
"""If you look out of this window, you'll see a shed with forty or more sprays of cloud-pine hanging on the wall.",未知
"One of them has been used by Serafina Pekkala, and the others have not.",未知
"Could you tell which is hers?""",未知
"""Yeah!""",未知
"said Lyra, always ready to show off, and she took the alethiometer and hurried out.",未知
"She was eager to see cloud-pine, because the witches used it for flying, and she'd never seen any before.",未知
"The two men stood by the window and watched as she kicked her way through the snow, Pantalaimon bouncing beside her as a hare, to stand in front of the wooden shed, head down, manipulating the alethiometer.",未知
After a few seconds she reached forward and unhesitatingly picked out one of the many sprays of pine and held it up.,未知
Dr. Lanselius nodded.,未知
"Lyra, intrigued and eager to fly, held it above her head and jumped, and ran about in the snow trying to be a witch.",未知
"The consul turned to Farder Coram and said: ""Do you realize who this child is?""",未知
"""She's the daughter of Lord Asriel,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""And her mother is Mrs. Coulter, of the Oblation Board.""",未知
"""And apart from that?""",未知
The old gyptian had to shake his head.,未知
"""No,"" he said, ""I don't know any more.",未知
"But she's a strange innocent creature, and I wouldn't have her harmed for the world.",未知
"How she comes to read that instrument I couldn't guess, but I believe her when she talks of it.",未知
"Why, Dr. Lanselius?",特殊疑问句
"What do you know about her?""",未知
"""The witches have talked about this child for centuries past,"" said the consul.",未知
"""Because they live so close to the place where the veil between the worlds is thin, they hear immortal whispers from time to time, in the voices of those beings who pass between the worlds.",未知
"And they have spoken of a child such as this, who has a great destiny that can only be fulfilled elsewhere-not in this world, but far beyond.",未知
"Without this child, we shall all die.",未知
So the witches say.,未知
"But she must fulfill this destiny in ignorance of what she is doing, because only in her ignorance can we be saved.",未知
"Do you understand that, Farder Coram?""",未知
"""No,"" said Farder Coram, ""I'm unable to say that I do.""",未知
"""What it means is that she must be free to make mistakes.",未知
"We must hope that she does not, but we can't guide her.",未知
"I am glad to have seen this child before I die.""",未知
"""But how did you recognize her as being that particular child?",未知
And what did you mean about the beings who pass between the worlds?,未知
"I'm at a loss to understand you, Dr. Lanselius, for all that I judge you're an honest man....""
But before the consul could answer, the door opened and Lyra came in bearing a little branch of pine.",未知
"""This is the one!""",未知
she said.,未知
"""I tested 'em all, and this is it, I'm sure.",未知
"But it won't fly for me.""",未知
"The consul said, ""Well, Lyra, that is remarkable.",未知
"You are lucky to have an instrument like that, and I wish you well with it.",未知
"I would like to give you something to take away with you....""
He took the spray and broke off a twig for her.",未知
"""Did she really fly with this?""",未知
Lyra said.,未知
"""Yes, she did.",未知
"But then she is a witch, and you are not.",未知
"I can't give you all of it, because I need it to contact her, but this will be enough.",未知
"Look after it.""",未知
"""Yes, I will,"" she said.",未知
"""Thank you.""",未知
And she tucked it into her purse beside the alethiometer.,未知
"Farder Coram touched the spray of pine as if for luck, and on his face was an expression Lyra had never seen before: almost a longing.",未知
"The consul showed them to the door, where he shook hands with Farder Coram, and shook Lyra's hand too.",未知
"""I hope you find success,"" he said, and stood on his doorstep in the piercing cold to watch them up the little street.",未知
"""He knew the answer about the Tartars before I did,"" Lyra told Farder Coram.",未知
"""The alethiometer told me, but I never said.",未知
"It was the crucible.""",未知
"""I expect he was testing you, child.",未知
"But you done right to be polite, being as we can't be sure what he knows already.",未知
And that was a useful tip about the bear.,未知
"I don't know how we would a heard otherwise.""",未知
"They found their way to the depot, which was a couple of concrete warehouses in a scrubby area of waste ground where thin weeds grew between gray rocks and pools of icy mud.",主谓宾
"A surly man in an office told them that they could find the bear off duty at six, but they'd have to be quick, because he usually went straight to the yard behind Einarsson's Bar, where they gave him drink.",未知
Then Farder Coram took Lyra to the best outfitter's in town and bought her some proper cold-weather clothing.,未知
"They bought a parka made of reindeer skin, because reindeer hair is hollow and insulates well; and the hood was lined with wolverine fur, because that sheds the ice that forms when you breathe.",未知
"They bought underclothing and boot liners of reindeer calf skin, and silk gloves to go inside big fur mittens.",未知
"The boots and mittens were made of skin from the reindeer's forelegs, because that is extra tough, and the boots were soled with the skin of the bearded seal, which is as tough as walrus hide, but lighter.",未知
"Finally they bought a waterproof cape that enveloped her completely, made of semitransparent seal intestine.",未知
"With all that on, and a silk muffler around her neck and a woollen cap over her ears and the big hood pulled forward, she was uncomfortably warm; but they were going to much colder regions than this.",未知
"John Faa had been supervising the unloading of the ship, and was keen to hear about the witch consul's words, and even keener to learn of the bear.",未知
"""We'll go to him this very evening,"" he said.",未知
"""Have you ever spoken to such a creature, Farder Coram?""",未知
"""Yes, I have; and fought one, too, though not by myself, thank God.",未知
"We must be ready to treat with him, John.",未知
"He'll ask a lot, I've no doubt, and be surly and difficult to manage; but we must have him.""",未知
"""Oh, we must.",未知
"And what of your witch?""",未知
"""Well, she's a long way off, and a clan queen now,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""I did hope it might be possible for a message to reach her, but it would take too long to wait for a reply.""",未知
"""Ah, well.",未知
"Now let me tell you what I've found, old friend.""",未知
For John Faa had been fidgeting with impatience to tell them something.,未知
"He had met a prospector on the quayside, a New Dane from the country of Texas, and this man had a balloon, of all things.",未知
"The expedition he'd been hoping to join had failed for lack of funds even before it had left Amsterdam, so he was stranded.",未知
"""Think what we might do with the help of an aeronaut, Farder Coram!""",未知
"said John Faa, rubbing his great hands together.",未知
"""I've engaged him to sign up with us.",未知
"Seems to me we struck lucky a coming here.""",未知
"""Luckier still if we had a clear idea of where we were going,"" said Farder Coram, but nothing could damp John Faa's pleasure in being on campaign once more.",未知
"After darkness had fallen, and when the stores and equipment had all been safely unloaded and stood in waiting on the quay, Farder Coram and Lyra walked along the waterfront and looked for Einarsson's Bar.",未知
They found it easily enough: a crude concrete shed with a red neon sign flashing irregularly over the door and the sound of loud voices through the condensation-frosted windows.,主谓宾
"A pitted alley beside it led to a sheet-metal gate into a rear yard, where a lean-to shed stood crazily over a floor of frozen mud.",未知
Dim yellow light through the rear window of the bar showed a vast pale form crouching upright and gnawing at a haunch of meat which it held in both hands.,未知
"Lyra had an impression of bloodstained muzzle and face, small malevolent black eyes, and an immensity of dirty matted yellowish fur.",未知
"As it gnawed, hideous growling, crunching, sucking noises came from it.",未知
"Farder Coram stood by the gate and called:
""lorek Byrnison!""",未知
The bear stopped eating.,未知
"As far as they could tell, he was looking at them directly, but it was impossible to read any expression on his face.",未知
"""lorek Byrnison,"" said Farder Coram again.",未知
"""May I speak to you?""",未知
"Lyra's heart was thumping hard, because something in the bear's presence made her feel close to coldness, danger, brutal power, but a power controlled by intelligence; and not a human intelligence, nothing like a human, because of course bears had no daemons.",未知
"This strange hulking presence gnawing its meat was like nothing she had ever imagined, and she felt a profound admiration and pity for the lonely creature.",未知
He dropped the reindeer leg in the dirt and slumped on all fours to the gate.,未知
"Then he reared up massively, ten feet or more high, as if to show how mighty he was, to remind them how useless the gate would be as a barrier, and he spoke to them from that height.",未知
"""Well?",未知
"Who are you?""",未知
His voice was so deep it seemed to shake the earth.,未知
The rank smell that came from his body was almost overpowering.,未知
"""I'm Farder Coram, from the gyptian people of Eastern Anglia.",未知
"And this little girl is Lyra Belacqua.""",未知
"""What do you want?""",未知
"""We want to offer you employment, lorek Byrnison.""",未知
"""I am employed.""",未知
The bear dropped on all fours again.,未知
"It was very hard to detect any expressive tones in his voice, whether of irony or anger, because it was so deep and so flat.",未知
"""What do you do at the sledge depot?""",未知
Farder Coram asked.,未知
"""I mend broken machinery and articles of iron.",未知
"I lift heavy objects.""",未知
"""What kind of work is that for a panserbjorn?""",未知
"""Paid work.""",未知
"Behind the bear, the door of the bar opened a little way and a man put down a large earthenware jar before looking up to peer at them.",未知
"""Who's that?""",未知
he said.,未知
"""Strangers,"" said the bear.",未知
"The bartender looked as if he was going to ask something more, but the bear lurched toward him suddenly and the man shut the door in alarm.",未知
The bear hooked a claw through the handle of the jar and lifted it to his mouth.,未知
Lyra could smell the tang of the raw spirits that splashed out.,未知
"After swallowing several times, the bear put the jar down and turned back to gnaw his haunch of meat, heedless of Farder Coram and Lyra, it seemed; but then he spoke again.",未知
"""What work are you offering?""",未知
"""Fighting, in all probability,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""We're moving north until we find a place where they've taken some children captive.",未知
"When we find it, we'll have to fight to get the children free; and then we'll bring them back.""",未知
"""And what will you pay?""",未知
"""I don't know what to offer you, lorek Byrnison.",未知

"""No good.""",未知
"""What do they pay you at the sledge depot?""",未知
"""My keep here in meat and spirits.""",未知
"Silence from the bear; and then he dropped the ragged bone and lifted the jar to his muzzle again, drinking the powerful spirits like water.",未知
"""Forgive me for asking, lorek Byrnison,"" said Farder Coram, ""but you could live a free proud life on the ice hunting seals and walruses, or you could go to war and win great prizes.",未知
"What ties you to Trollesund and Einarsson's Bar?""",未知
Lyra felt her skin shiver all over.,主谓宾
"She would have thought a question like that, which was almost an insult, would enrage the great creature beyond reason, and she wondered at Farder Coram's courage in asking it.",未知
lorek Byrnison put down his jar and came close to the gate to peer at the old man's face.,未知
Farder Coram didn't flinch.,未知
"""I know the people you are seeking, the child cutters,"" the bear said.",未知
"""They left town the day before yesterday to go north with more children.",未知
"No one will tell you about them; they pretend not to see, because the child cutters bring money and business.",未知
"Now, I don't like the child cutters, so I shall answer you politely.",未知
"I stay here and drink spirits because the men here took my armor away, and without that, I can hunt seals but I can't go to war; and I am an armored bear; war is the sea I swim in and the air I breathe.",未知

"If you want my service, the price is this: get me back my armor.",未知

When they returned to the ship, Farder Coram and John Faa and the other leaders spent a long time in conference in the saloon, and Lyra went to her cabin to consult the alethiome-ter.",未知

"How different it was to be human, with one's daemon always there to talk to!",感叹句
"In the silence of the still ship, without the continual creak of metal and timber or the rumble of the engine or the rush of water along the side, Lyra gradually fell asleep, with Pantalaimon on her pillow sleeping too.",未知
"She was dreaming of her great imprisoned father when suddenly, for no reason at all, she woke up.",未知
She had no idea what time it was.,未知
"There was a faint light in the cabin that she took for moonlight, and it showed her new cold-weather furs that lay stiffly in the corner of the cabin.",there be句型
No sooner did she see them than she longed to try them on again.,未知
"Once they were on, she had to go out on deck, and a minute later she opened the door at the top of the compan-ionway and stepped out.",未知
At once she saw that something strange was happening in the sky.,未知
"She thought it was clouds, moving and trembling under a nervous agitation, but Pantalaimon whispered:
""The Aurora!""",未知
Her wonder was so strong that she had to clutch the rail to keep from falling.,未知
The sight filled the northern sky; the immensity of it was scarcely conceivable.,未知
"As if from Heaven itself, great curtains of delicate light hung and trembled.",未知
"Pale green and rose-pink, and as transparent as the most fragile fabric, and at the bottom edge a profound and fiery crimson like the fires of Hell, they swung and shimmered loosely with more grace than the most skillful dancer.",未知
Lyra thought she could even hear them: a vast distant whispering swish.,主谓宾
In the evanescent delicacy she felt something as profound as she'd felt close to the bear.,未知
"She was moved by it; it was so beautiful it was almost holy; she felt tears prick her eyes, and the tears splintered the light even further into prismatic rainbows.",未知
It wasn't long before she found herself entering the same kind of trance as when she consulted the alethiometer.,未知
"Perhaps, she thought calmly, whatever moves the alethiometer's needle is making the Aurora glow too.",未知
It might even be Dust itself.,未知
"She thought that without noticing that she'd thought it, and she soon forgot it, and only remembered it much later.",未知
"And as she gazed, the image of a city seemed to form itself behind the veils and streams of translucent color: towers and domes, honey-colored temples and colonnades, broad boulevards and sunlit parkland.",未知
"Looking at it gave her a sense of vertigo, as if she were looking not up but down, and across a gulf so wide that nothing could ever pass over it.",未知
It was a whole universe away.,未知
"But something was moving across it, and as she tried to focus her eyes on the movement, she felt faint and dizzy, because the little thing moving wasn't part of the Aurora or
of the other universe behind it.",未知
It was in the sky over the roofs of the town.,未知
"When she could see it clearly, she had come fully awake and the sky city was gone.",未知
The flying thing came closer and circled the ship on outspread wings.,未知
"Then it glided down and landed with brisk sweeps of its powerful pinions, and came to a halt on the wooden deck a few yards from Lyra.",未知
"In the Aurora's light she saw a great bird, a beautiful gray goose whose head was crowned with a flash of pure white.",未知
"And yet it wasn't a bird: it was a daemon, though there was no one in sight but Lyra herself.",未知
The idea filled her with sickly fear.,未知
"The bird said:
""Where is Farder Coram?""",未知
And suddenly Lyra realized who it must be.,未知

""I-he's-I'll go and get him....""
She turned and scampered down the companionway to the cabin Farder Coram occupied, and opened the door to speak into the darkness:
""Farder Coram!",未知
The witch's daemon's come!,未知
He's waiting on the deck!,未知
"He flew here all by hisself-I seen him coming in the sky-""
The old man said, ""Ask him to wait on the afterdeck, child.""",未知
"The goose made his stately way to the stern of the ship, where he looked around, elegant and wild simultaneously, and a cause of fascinated terror to Lyra, who felt as though she were entertaining a ghost.",未知
"Then Farder Coram came up, wrapped in his cold-weather gear, closely followed by John Faa.",未知
"Both old men bowed respectfully, and their daemons also acknowledged the visitor.",未知
"""Greetings,"" said Farder Coram.",未知
"""And I'm happy and proud to see you again, Kaisa.",未知
"Now, would you like to come inside, or would you prefer to stay out here in the open?""",未知
"""I would rather stay outside, thank you, Farder Coram.",未知
"Are you warm enough for a while?""",未知
"Witches and their daemons felt no cold, but they were aware that other humans did.",未知
"Farder Coram assured him that they were well wrapped up, and said, ""How is Serafina Pekkala?""",未知
"""She sends her greetings to you, Farder Coram, and she is well and strong.",未知

Farder Coram introduced them both.,未知
The goose daemon looked hard at Lyra.,未知

"""What is this Dust?""",未知
"""It comes from the sky.",未知
"Some say it has always been there, some say it is newly falling.",未知

"But it is not of any concern to witches.""",未知
"""And where are they now, these Dust hunters?""",未知
"""Four days northeast of here, at a place called Bolvangar.",未知
"Our clan made no agreement with them, and because of our longstanding obligation to you, Farder Coram, I have come to show you how to find these Dust hunters.""",未知
"Farder Coram smiled, and John Faa clapped his great hands together in satisfaction.",未知

Witches can see these things where other humans can't.,未知
Animals keep away too.,未知
No birds fly there; lemmings and foxes have fled.,未知
Hence the name Bolvangar: the fields of evil.,未知
They don't call it that.,未知
They call it 'the station.',未知
"But to everyone else it is Bolvangar.""",未知
"""And how are they defended?""",未知
"""They have a company of Northern Tartars armed with rifles.",未知
"They are good soldiers, but they lack practice, because no one has ever attacked the settlement since it was built.",未知

"There may be other means of defense that we don't know about, because as I say they have no interest for us.""",未知
"Lyra was bursting to ask a question, and the goose dasmon knew it and looked at her as if giving permission.",未知
"""Why do the witches talk about me?""",未知
she said.,未知
"""Because of your father, and his knowledge of the other worlds,"" the daemon replied.",未知
That surprised all three of them.,未知
"Lyra looked at Farder Coram, who looked back in mild wonder, and at John Faa, whose expression was troubled.",未知
"""Other worlds?""",未知
John Faa said.,未知
"""Pardon me, sir, but what worlds would those be?",未知
"Do you mean the stars?""",未知
"""Indeed no.""",未知
"""Perhaps the world of spirits?""",未知

"""Nor that.""",未知
"""Is it the city in the lights?""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""It is, en't it?""",未知

There was a lightness in Lyra's head.,there be句型

"""Yes,"" said the goose daemon.",未知
"""They don't believe he can, because they think he is mad to believe in the other worlds in the first place.",未知

"And he is so powerful a figure that they feared he would upset their own plans, so they made a pact with the armored bears to capture him and keep him imprisoned in the fortress of Svalbard, out of the way.",未知

"""What about the bears?""",未知
said Lyra.,未知
"""Whose side are they on?""",未知
"""On the side of anyone who pays them.",未知
They have no interest whatever in these questions; they have no daemons; they are unconcerned about human problems.,未知
"At least, that is how bears used to be, but we have heard that their new king is intent on changing their old ways....At any rate, the Dust hunters have paid them to imprison Lord Asriel, and they will hold him on Svalbard until the last drop of blood drains from the body of the last bear alive.""",未知
"""But not all bears!""",未知
Lyra said.,未知
"""There's one who en't on Svalbard at all.",未知
"He's an outcast bear, and he's going to come with us.""",未知
The goose gave Lyra another of his piercing looks.,未知
This time she could feel his cold surprise.,未知
"Farder Coram shifted uncomfortably, and said, ""The fact is, Lyra, I don't think he is.",未知

"""Like a slave!""",未知
Lyra said hotly.,未知
"""They hadn't got the right!""",未知
"""Be that as it may, they might have shot him for the killings he done, but they didn't.",未知

"""But now, sir, can you tell us how to get to Bolvangar from here?""",未知
The goose daemon began to explain.,未知
"He spoke of valleys and hills, of the tree line and the tundra, of star sightings.",未知
"Lyra listened awhile, and then lay back in the deck chair with Pantalaimon curled around her neck, and thought of the grand vision the goose daemon had brought with him.",未知
A bridge between two worlds...This was far more splendid than anything she could have hoped for!,未知
And only her great father could have conceived it.,未知
"As soon as they had rescued the children, she would go to Svalbard with the bear and take Lord Asriel the alethiometer, and use it to help set him free; and they'd build the bridge together, and be the first across....",未知
"Sometime in the night John Faa must have carried Lyra to her bunk, because that was where she awoke.",未知

"Soon, when they moved further north, there would be no sun at all.",未知
She dressed quickly and ran on deck to find nothing very much happening.,未知
"All the stores had been unloaded, sledges and dog teams had been hired and were waiting to go; everything was ready and nothing was moving.",未知

"""Yeah!""",未知
"she said, and explained all about him.",未知

"""So you've spoken to old lorek?""",未知
he said.,未知
She looked at the newcomer with surprise.,未知
"He was a tall, lean man with a thin black moustache and narrow blue eyes, and a perpetual expression of distant and sardonic amusement.",未知
"She felt strongly about him at once, but she wasn't sure whether it was liking she felt, or dislike.",未知
His daemon was a shabby hare as thin and tough-looking as he was.,未知
He held out his hand and she shook it warily.,未知
"""Lee Scoresby,"" he said.",未知
"""The aeronaut!""",未知

"""Where's your balloon?",未知
"Can I go up in it?""",未知

"""You know him?""",未知
"""I fought beside him in the Tunguska campaign.",未知

A pack of cards had appeared from nowhere in his hand.,未知
He riffled them with a snapping noise.,主谓宾
"""Now I've heard of the card power of your people,"" Lee Scoresby was saying, cutting and folding the cards over and over with one hand and fishing a cigar out of his breast pocket with the other, ""and I thought you wouldn't object to giving a simple Texan traveler the chance to joust with your skill and daring on the field of pasteboard combat.",未知

"Gyptians prided themselves on their ability with cards, and several of the men looked interested and pulled their chairs up.",主谓宾
"While they were agreeing with Lee Scoresby what to play and for what stakes, his daemon flicked her ears at Pantalaimon, who understood and leaped to her side lightly as a squirrel.",未知
"She was speaking for Lyra's ears too, of course, and Lyra heard her say quietly, ""Go straight to the bear and tell him direct.",未知
"As soon as they know what's going on, they'll move his armor somewhere else.""",未知
"Lyra got up, taking her spice cake with her, and no one noticed; Lee Scoresby was already dealing the cards, and every suspicious eye was on his hands.",未知
"In the dull light, fading through an endless afternoon, she found her way to the sledge depot.",未知
"It was something she knew she had to do, but she felt uneasy about it, and afraid, too.",主谓宾
"Outside the largest of the concrete sheds the great bear was working, and Lyra stood by the open gate to watch.",未知
lorek Byrnison was dismantling a gas-engined tractor that had crashed; the metal covering of the engine was twisted and buckled and one runner bent upward.,未知
"The bear lifted the metal off as if it were cardboard, and turned it this way and that in his great hands, seeming to test it for some quality or other, before setting a rear paw on one corner and then bending the whole sheet in such a way that the dents sprang out and the shape was restored.",未知
"Leaning it against the wall, he lifted the massive weight of the tractor with one paw and laid it on its side before bending to examine the crumpled runner.",未知
"As he did so, he caught sight of Lyra.",未知
"She felt a bolt of cold fear strike at her, because he was so massive and so alien.",未知
"She was gazing through the chain-link fence about forty yards from him, and she thought how he could clear the distance in a bound or two and sweep the wire aside like a cobweb, and she almost turned and ran away; but Pantalaimon said, ""Stop!",未知
"Let me go and talk to him.""",未知
"He was a tern, and before she could answer he'd flown off the fence and down to the icy ground beyond it.",未知
"There was an open gate a little way along, and Lyra could have followed him, but she hung back uneasily.",there be句型
"Pantalaimon looked at her, and then became a badger.",未知
She knew what he was doing.,未知
"Daemons could move no more than a few yards from their humans, and if she stood by the fence and he remained a bird, he wouldn't get near the bear; so he was going to pull.",未知
She felt angry and miserable.,未知
His badger claws dug into the earth and he walked forward.,未知
"It was such a strange tormenting feeling when your daemon was pulling at the link between you; part physical pain deep in the chest, part intense sadness and love.",未知
And she knew it was the same for him.,未知
"Everyone tested it when they were growing up: seeing how far they could pull apart, coming back with intense relief.",主谓宾
He tugged a little harder.,未知
"""Don't, Pan!""",未知
But he didn't stop.,未知
"The bear watched, motionless.",未知
"The pain in Lyra's heart grew more and more unbearable, and a sob of longing rose in her throat.",未知
"""Pan-""
Then she was through the gate, scrambling over the icy mud toward him, and he turned into a wildcat and sprang up into her arms, and they were clinging together tightly with little shaky sounds of unhappiness coming from them both.",未知
"""I thought you really would-""
""No-""
""I couldn't believe how much it hurt-""
And then she brushed the tears away angrily and sniffed hard.",未知
"He nestled in her arms, and she knew she would rather die than let them be parted and face that sadness again; it would send her mad with grief and terror.",未知
"If she died, they'd still be together, like the Scholars in the crypt at Jordan.",未知
Then girl and daemon looked up at the solitary bear.,未知
He had no daemon.,未知
"He was alone, always alone.",未知
"She felt such a stir of pity and gentleness for him that she almost reached out to touch his matted pelt, and only a sense of courtesy toward those cold ferocious eyes prevented her.",未知
"""lorek Byrnison,"" she said.",未知
"""Well?""",未知
"""Lord Faa and Farder Coram have gone to try and get your armor for you.""",未知
He didn't move or speak.,未知

"""How do you know where it is?""",未知
"""I got a symbol reader.",未知

"""Lyra Belacqua.""",未知
"""Then I owe you a debt, Lyra Belacqua,"" he said.",未知

"She did run, though, and Pantalaimon flew up as a seagull to watch where the bear went and called down to tell her where to follow.",未知
"Iorek Byrnison bounded out of the depot and along the narrow street before turning into the main street of the town, past the courtyard of the sysselman's residence where a flag hung in the still air and a sentry marched stiffly up and down, down the hill past the end of the street where the witch consul lived.",未知
"The sentry by this time had realized what was happening, and was trying to gather his wits, but lorek Byrnison was already turning a corner near the harbor.",未知
People stopped to watch or scuttled out of his careering way.,未知
"The sentry fired two shots in the air, and set off down the hill after the bear, spoiling the effect by skidding on the icy slope and only regaining his balance after seizing the nearest railings.",未知
Lyra was not far behind.,未知
"As she passed the syssel-man's house, she was aware of a number of figures coming out into the courtyard to see what was going on, and thought she saw Farder Coram among them; but then she was past, hurtling down the street toward the corner where the sentry was already turning to follow the bear.",未知
"The priest's house was older than most, and made of costly bricks.",未知
"Three steps led up to the front door, which was now hanging in matchwood splinters, and from inside the house came screams and the crashing and tearing of more wood.",未知
"The sentry hesitated outside, his rifle at the ready; but then as passers-by began to gather and people looked out of windows from across the street, he realized that he had to act, and fired a shot into the air before running in.",未知
"A moment later, the whole house seemed to shake.",未知
"Glass broke in three windows and a tile slid off the roof, and then a maidservant ran out, terrified, her clucking hen of a daemon flapping after her.",未知
"Another shot came from inside the house, and then a full-throated roar made the servant scream.",未知
"As if fired from a cannon, the priest himself came hurtling out, with his pelican daemon in a wild flutter of feathers and injured pride.",未知
"Lyra heard orders shouted, and turned to see a squad of armed policemen hurrying around the corner, some with pistols and some with rifles, and not far behind them came John Faa and the stout, fussy figure of the sysselman.",主谓宾
"A rending, splintering sound made them all look back at the house.",未知
"A window at ground level, obviously opening on a cellar, was being wrenched apart with a crash of glass and a screech of tearing wood.",未知
"The sentry who'd followed lorek Byrnison into the house came running out and stood to face the cellar window, rifle at his shoulder; and then the window tore open completely, and out climbed lorek Byrnison, the bear in armor.",未知
"Without it, he was formidable.",未知
"With it, he was terrifying.",未知
"It was rust-red, and crudely riveted together: great sheets and plates of dented discolored metal that scraped and screeched as they rode over one another.",未知
"The helmet was pointed like his muzzle, with slits for eyes, and it left the lower part of his jaw bare for tearing and biting.",未知
"The sentry fired several shots, and the policemen leveled their weapons too, but lorek Byrnison merely shook the bullets off like raindrops, and lunged forward in a screech and clang of metal before the sentry could escape, and knocked him to the ground.",未知
"His daemon, a husky dog, darted at the bear's throat, but lorek Byrnison took no more notice of him than he would of a fly, and dragging the sentry to him with one vast paw, he bent and enclosed his head in his jaws.",未知
"Lyra could see exactly what would happen next: he'd crush the man's skull like an egg, and there would follow a bloody fight, more deaths, and more delay; and they would never get free, with or without the bear.",未知
"Without even thinking, she darted forward and put her hand on the one vulnerable spot in the bear's armor, the gap that appeared between the helmet and the great plate over his shoulders when he bent his head, where she could see the yellow-white fur dimly between the rusty edges of metal.",未知
"She dug her fingers in, and Pantalaimon instantly flew to the same spot and became a wildcat, crouched to defend her; but lorek Byrnison was still, and the riflemen held their fire.",主谓宾

No one else moved.,未知
"They watched the bear turn away from his victim at the bidding of the girl with the cat daemon, and then they shuffled aside to make room as lorek Byrnison padded heavily through the midst of them at Lyra's side and made for the harbor.",未知
"Her mind was all on him, and she didn't see the confusion behind her, the fear and the anger that rose up safely when he was gone.",未知
"She walked with him, and Pantalaimon padded ahead of them both as if to clear the way.",未知
"When they reached the harbor, lorek Byrnison dipped his head and unfastened the helmet with a claw, letting it clang on the frozen ground.",未知
"Gyptians came out of the cafe, having sensed that something was going on, and watched in the gleam of the anbaric lights on the ship's deck as lorek Byrnison shrugged off the rest of his armor and left it in a heap on the quayside.",未知

He had finished oiling the armor.,未知
"Not wanting to waste the seal meat, he lifted the carcass in his teeth and flipped it onto the back of Lee Scoresby's larger sledge before donning the armor.",未知
"It was astonishing to see how lightly he dealt with it: the sheets of metal were almost an inch thick in places, and yet he swung them round and into place as if they were silk robes.",未知

"She marveled at the skill of his hands: unlike most bears, he and his kin had opposable thumb claws with which they could hold things still to work on them; and he had some innate sense of the strength and flexibility of metals which meant that he only had to lift it once or twice, flex it this way and that, and he could run a claw over it in a circle to score it for folding.",未知
"He did this now, folding the sides in and in until they stood in a raised rim and then making a lid to fit it.",未知

"You didn't foresee this, and I didn't help you!",未知
"But she had no more than a second to think that, for there was a mighty snarl from Pantalaimon, and something- another daemon-hurtled at him and knocked him down, crushing all the breath out of Lyra herself; and then hands were hauling at her, lifting her, stifling her cry with foul-smelling mittens, tossing her through the air into another's arms, and then pushing her flat down into the snow again, so that she was dizzy and breathless and hurt all at once.",未知
"Her arms were hauled behind till her shoulders cracked, and someone lashed her wrists together, and then a hood was crammed over her head to muffle her screams, for scream she did, and lustily:
""lorek!",未知
lorek Byrnison!,未知
"Help me!""",未知
But could he hear?,未知
"She couldn't tell; she was hurled this way and that, crushed onto a hard surface which then began to lurch and bump like a sledge.",未知
The sounds that reached her were wild and confused.,未知
"She might have heard lorek Byrnison's roar, but it was a long way off, and then she was jolting over rough ground, arms twisted, mouth stifled, sobbing with rage and fear.",未知
And strange voices spoke around her.,未知
"""Pan...""
""I'm here, shh, I'll help you breathe.",未知
"Keep still...""
His mouse paws tugged at the hood until her mouth was freer, and she gulped at the frozen air.",未知
"""Who are they?""",未知
she whispered.,未知
"""They look like Tartars.",未知
"I think they hit John Faa.""",未知
"""No-""
""I saw him fall.",未知
But he should have been ready for this sort of attack.,未知
"We know that.""",未知
"""But we should have helped him!",未知
"We should have been watching the alethiometer!""",未知
"""Hush.",未知
"Pretend to be unconscious.""",未知
"There was a whip cracking, and the howl of racing dogs.",there be句型
"From the way she was being jerked and bounced about, Lyra could tell how fast they were going, and though she strained to hear the sounds of battle, all she made out was a forlorn volley of shots, muffled by the distance, and then the creak and rush and soft paw thuds in the snow were all there was to hear.",未知
"""They'll take us to the Gobblers,"" she whispered.",未知
The word severed came to their mind.,未知
"Horrible fear filled Lyra's body, and Pantalaimon nestled close against her.",未知
"""I'll fight,"" he said.",未知
"""So will I. I'll kill them.""",未知
"""So will lorek when he finds out.",未知
"He'll crush them to death.""",未知
"""How far are we from Bolvangar?""",未知
"Pantalaimon didn't know, but he thought it was less than a day's ride.",未知
"After they had been driving along for such a time that Lyra's body was in torment from cramp, the pace slackened a little, and someone roughly pulled off the hood.",未知
"She looked up at a broad Asiatic face, under a wolverine hood, lit by flickering lamplight.",未知
"His black eyes showed a glint of satisfaction, especially when Pantalaimon slid out of Lyra's anorak to bare his white ermine teeth in a hiss.",未知
"The man's daemon, a big heavy wolverine, snarled back, but Pantalaimon didn't flinch.",未知
The man hauled Lyra up to a sitting position and propped her against the side of the sledge.,未知
"She kept falling sideways because her hands were still tied behind her, and so he tied her feet together instead and released her hands.",未知
"Through the snow that was falling and the thick fog she saw how powerful this man was, and the sledge driver too, how balanced in the sledge, how much at home in this land in a way the gyptians weren't.",未知
"The man spoke, but of course she understood nothing.",未知
He tried a different language with the same result.,未知
Then he tried English.,未知
"""You name?""",未知
"Pantalaimon bristled warningly, and she knew what he meant at once.",未知
So these men didn't know who she was!,未知
They hadn't kidnapped her because of her connection with Mrs. Coulter; so perhaps they weren't in the pay of the Gobblers after all.,未知
"""Lizzie Brooks,"" she said.",未知
"""Lissie Broogs,"" he said after her.",未知
"""We take you nice place.",未知
"Nice peoples.""",未知

Nice peoples.,未知
"You have panserbjorne?""",未知
"""For protection.""",未知
"""No good!",未知
"Ha, ha, bear no good!",未知
"We got you anyway!""",未知
He laughed loudly.,未知
Lyra controlled herself and said nothing.,主谓宾
"""Who those peoples?""",未知
"the man asked next, pointing back the way they had come.",未知
"""Traders.""",未知
"""Traders...What they trade?""",未知
"""Fur, spirits,"" she said.",未知
"""Smokeleaf.""",未知
"""They sell smokeleaf, buy furs?""",未知
"""Yes.""",未知
"He said something to his companion, who spoke back briefly.",主谓宾
"All the time the sledge was speeding onward, and Lyra pulled herself up more comfortably to try and see where they were heading; but the snow was falling thickly, and the sky was dark, and presently she became too cold to peer out any longer, and lay down.",未知
"She and Pantalaimon could feel each other's thoughts, and tried to keep calm, but the thought of John Faa dead...And what had happened to Farder Coram?",未知
And would lorek manage to kill the other Samoyeds?,未知
And would they ever manage to track her down?,未知
"For the first time, she began to feel a little sorry for herself.",未知
"After a long time, the man shook her by the shoulder and handed her a strip of dried reindeer meat to chew.",未知
"It was rank and tough, but she was hungry, and there was nourishment in it.",主谓宾
